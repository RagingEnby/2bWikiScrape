}}The **2b2t Census Bureau** is a community project which aims to obtain information about players. It's main area of ​​activity is the internal sociology of the server - the acquisition and analysis of its data. The head of the bureau is [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut).

The Bureau conducts a census at certain intervals, thus obtaining information about the changes experienced by players at different times and how the balance of power is being transformed. The Bureau, taking into account the multinationality of the server and the inaccessibility of English for some, also carries out its activities in the most common languages ​​on the server: Russian, Chinese, Spanish, Turkish.

The census questionnaire contains many questions, ranging from the number of accounts and gender to group affiliation and the presence of a client.

## 2023 IV quarter census
The results presented here are based on data collected a year ago in December 2023 by the [Society project](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Society). Represented in the data are ~360 responses, although many have blank sections, meaning that each question has about 300 usable datapoints, give or take. The full results and analysis can be viewed on the [bureau's server](https://discord.gg/2BXRNtuSGE).

### Participant information
Turning to the question of the year in which participants joined, the data is clear: before 2016, the number of those joining was extremely small, there was a large increase in 2016, then a decline for the next two years, and then a significant increase starting in 2019. The large decline in 2022 is especially noticeable, the reasons for which may be related to the gradual depletion of the server at that time, which may have prompted [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) to implement urgent reforms in 2023, not all of which were successful.

The age question of the participants was also expected: the majority are teenagers, 16-19 year olds. They make up 1/3 of the census participants. The share of older people is gradually declining․ The oldest participant is 57 years old.

The vast majority of participants are male. Men make up 90.4% of the participants. Women are fewer, 6.8%. There are also participants who consider themselves to be of a different gender playing on the server. Such participants make up 2.8%.

The majority of participants are loyal to the server, despite the many ambiguous steps taken by the management in 2023. Thus, 62.5% of participants do not play on any other server. However, this does not mean that there are no competitors to [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t). 19.4% of players play on Constantiam. 7.6% play on 9b9t. The rest play on less well-known projects, the share of which is not significant.

1/3 of the participants have only 1 account. However, almost as many have 2 accounts. As the number of accounts increases, the number of people who own them decreases. This pattern is broken by the number of people who have 10 or more accounts. This may be due to the fact that some, mainly well-known participants or those who are engaged in serious activities, maintain multiple accounts. Since 2b2t is an American project and has gained the most popularity there, it is clear how 57.3% of players are from North America. Every third player is from Europe. The rest is distributed between Australia, South America and Asia. There is no data from Africa.

### Socialization and grouping
Players are socialized: 81.1% of them are involved in groups. It is important to point out that there are players who are members of multiple groups, but there is no data about them. This 81% is distributed among several groups. According to the census, 19.4% are members of the [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) group. 7% are from the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood), the same number from the [SBA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association). 5.3% are [Masons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons). 16.2% of participants are involved in a group whose name was not given in the survey. The rest are involved in little-known groups.

Because players combine clients and use multiple and varied [Cheat clients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cheat_Clients), the bureau decided to select the first client listed in each response as that user's primary client. This is imperfect, but it is also the best possible option given the limitations. In subsequent censuses, this question was phrased more precisely. Using this methodology, it turns out that 46.3% use Future. About 1/3 of players use Rusherhack. Meteor is in third place, with 18.2% using it. The rest use other programs.

This is one of the few questions with less than the usual 300. Nearly half of the responses were players with 2 or less 'votes'. It cluttered the graph without adding significant insight to include either each answer individually, or grouped as collectively 'other', and so is not reflected on this graphic. Likewise, in keeping with past years, [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob) and [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) have been removed from the chart (they're inactive) - they otherwise are first and second place by a large margin. Bearing all this in mind, the remaining dataset is about 150 responses.

The top 3, given these constraints, are [Lukent](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lukent) - 13.6%, [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) - 8.2%, and [D_loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_loaded) - 6.8%.

## 2024 IV quarter census
{{Stub}}
The first census conducted by the bureau itself. The 2024 census was conducted starting on December 28, 2024. It was conducted taking into account the problems that were recorded last year. As a result, the census questionnaire was modified, and it was also translated into Russian, Chinese, Spanish, and Turkish. The census results will also be translated. Approximately 780 responses were collected from different participants in different languages. The census was completed on January 12, 2025 and the results were published on July 7, 2025. 626 English, 42 Russian, 31 Spanish, 30 Chinese, and 11 Turkish responses were analyzed.

The 2b2t Wedding event was an event that took place in May 2022.

## History
In May 2022 the players [Vertz](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vertz) and [HKK](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HKK) hosted a wedding on the server and invited FitMC over as the host. It soon became clear that - as opposed to a wedding organized earlier in 2020 - this wedding was not ‘real’ and just a joke. An event-base was established around 26 440, 6 740, containing multiple structures, including a church and a massive wedding cake. The [Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column) obtained the location and planned a raid of the event. However, the base was destroyed beforehand by [0Neb](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0Neb). For a second event new players were attracted, most notably [Franknificant](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Franknificant) and [Forceken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Forceken). A cathedral designed by [Franknificant](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Franknificant) and based on the Duomo from Florence was constructed within five days around 51 570, -20 990. The location was kept a secret, even to the ‘bride’ and ‘broom’. During the construction [Franknificant](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Franknificant) would get priority banned for no clear reason. [The Ancients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Ancients) added a floating heart and music machine to this location. The event was held on May 15th 2022. Since [FitMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FitMC) was unable to come, he was replaced by [SalC1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SalC1) as the ‘priest’. While performing the ceremony, the event was raided and destroyed by player [SyndicateNA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SyndicateNA) and multiple players - including the ‘wedding’ couple - were killed. After the event the griefer, the host and multiple guests were also priority banned.

## 500k Base
**500k Base** was a base built on 2builders2tools in the middle of 2012.
# History
**500k Base** was founded by [fr1kin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fr1kin), [Victormeriqui](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Victormeriqui), and [c0bra51,](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/c0bra51) during the summer of 2012 following the leak and self-grief of fr1kin's 2012 base. [x0XP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/x0XP) joined at the end of 2012. Notably this base is where fr1kin and x0XP would use the 1.3.2 signed book exploit to create the infamous 32k books. An early incarnation of this base can be seen in c0bra51's video showing an undisclosed invulnerability exploit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9Mn9fC77bU

The base featured many recognizable structures from that era of Minecraft such as two large floating islands, a large stone brick wall, and a pyramid. Notably, the base had a large underground mob farm which was accompanied by a railroad used to unload chunks to despawn bats. This was in combat of [Hausemaster's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) 130 entity per chunk limit during 2013. x0XP was the first member to depart from 500k base, leaving to join the [Valkyrians](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria) at [Asgard I](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Asgard_I). The downfall of the base began in [2015](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Timeline) with increase inactivity from c0bra51 and was only accelerated after [Victormeriqui](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Victormeriqui) was sent back to spawn after dying without his spawn point properly set. [fr1kin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fr1kin) left the base on December 20th, 2015 to "be closer to spawn". This left the base dormant as the only remaining member (c0bra51) had stopped playing 2b2t.

The base experienced a temporary revival after [Jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jared2013) came to the base in April of 2016 on x0XP's account 0xXP to "restore its former glory".

**500k Base** was griefed in September of 2016 after over 4 years of life, following the [Rusher Invasion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rusher_War).

## 4 Year Long Troll
**500k Base** was founded following the grief of [fr1kin's 2012 base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fr1kin%27s_2012_base).The leak was the result of [0xymoron](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0xymoron) playing a joke on another basemate, [brian5852](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/brian5852).  This joke resulted in the use of a [Denial Of Service (DOS) attack](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/understanding-denial-service-attacks) on [brian5852](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/brian5852). After his connection returned, brian5852 leaked the coordinates to fr1kin's 2012 base. After this, [fr1kin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fr1kin) who had access to [0xymoron's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0xymoron%27s) account as a result of previously helping him travel with the nether roof, logged back into his account and killed both brian5852 and 0xymoron's account back to spawn. fr1kin would then take brian5852's armor and display it at 500K base and constantly reminding 0xymoron about his loss. The pyramid at 500k base was a shrine built to hold [brian5852](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/brian5852)'s armor.

**[0xymoron](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0xymoron)** who was still active in 2016, had repaired his friendship with [fr1kin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fr1kin) enough that following the abandonment of **500k base**- he was given the coordinates to retrieve his friend's nearly half-decade old armor. However, unbeknownst to 0xymoron at the time- this armor was already gone and had been stolen by a player fr1kin had also shared coordinates with. [0xymoron](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0xymoron) spent "a long ass time" tracking the player in question down and trading for his friends armor back. Finally ending a 4 year long saga of verbal torment. [0xymoron](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0xymoron) would go on to display the armor at his museums until its eventual loss in the grief of [Ragnarok I.](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ragnarok)

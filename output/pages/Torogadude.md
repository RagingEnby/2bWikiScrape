<br />

**Torogadude**, nicknamed **Toro**, was a long-term [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) player who is most known for the #FreeToro movement during [the Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Rusher_War) and for his YouTube channel (which has since been privated).

## History
Torogadude first joined 2b2t on November 23rd, 2015. He started out by collecting resources and creating small bases. He started to be known a lot more as he began to interact with other older players, such as [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit).

### Rusher War
During the war, Toro got himself involved with [the 4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_4th_Reich) and [Team Veteran](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Veteran). He made videos about many of these experiences, which contributed to his YouTube channel being one of the largest out of the regular 2b2b players at that point.

Torogadude began to gain recognition on the server when he started to criticize [TheCampingRusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) after his [veteran queue](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Queue) was revoked over issues between him and one of the Queue admins. This caused a large public backlash against Rusher under the name of #FreeToro. His priority queue was later restored after Rusher caved into the pressure from the community.

### Post-War
After the war, Torogadude began to focus more on his channel. Eventually, he started several live streams related to 2b2t and built a base in the End called the [Death Star II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Small_Bases#Death_Star_II). However, he died during the construction when he accidentally left his player in AFK mode and it looked at an enderman, which later killed him. Toro later returned to the [Death Star II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Small_Bases#Death_Star_II) and continued construction.

In the time between Toro dying at the [Death Star II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Small_Bases#Death_Star_II) and returning to it, he started a new project called [Toro's Theater](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Toro%27s_Theater), an underground European-style theatre build, in the meantime. He also joined [Team Pepsi](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Pepsi) at this time when [the 4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_4th_Reich) disbanded and has been a member since. He joined due to influence from other Pepsi members in his discord.

### End of 2b2t content
In March 2018, Torogadude announced that he no longer would be making 2b2t Minecraft content on his channel. This was long expected, as he had been suggesting his 2b2t viewers go and watch his other, more interesting, non-2b2t content. He still says he would keep in touch with the people of the server and has been seen on the subreddit since.

### 2020
Torogadude livestreamed on 2b2t on November 23rd, 2020 and stated that he would be back every six months for a 2b2t stream.

## Past Role on the Server
Torogadude ran a YouTube channel by the same name. He was a commentator on 2b2t's events, explaining the various dupes, exploits, and other things related to 2b. He was well known for streaming his (now griefed) [Death Star II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Small_Bases#Death_Star_II) in the End and also used to do several other livestream series on 2b2t, such as the 2b2t Podcast, A walk on 2b2t, The Hunt, etc. He had about 11.5k subscribers on his channel at its peak but has slowly been declining in views and subscribers since he quit making 2b2t videos on his channel, therefore he has little relevance on the server any longer.

## History
### Activity on 2b2t
Zltb joined 2b2t on May 3rd, 2014 but had little activity until fall of 2016. He rarely talked in chat and had minimal interaction with others.

He became more active in mid-2016, where he became involved in bed bombing and later [Crystal PvP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crystal_PvP) at spawn. Zltb soon became enemies with [The 4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_4th_Reich) and frequently engaged in spawn pvp fight with their members, resulting in their leader [Tim_McNukepants](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tim_McNukepants) being killed. Zltb also joined Paranormal and maintained a close friendship with the leader, [ImmortalYogurt](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ImmortalYogurt). This small group often worked closely with the Peacekeepers to control spawn via pvp. On December 22nd, 2016, Zltb helped lead a "meme incursion" called the 5.69th spawn incursion.. Zltb was supported by other members of Paranormal such as [RobMaster21](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/RobMaster21) and [SpiritBG](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpiritBG).

On December 30th, 2016, Zltb flew thousands of blocks through the end and blew up Schitstane, an 11/11 dupe stash/end base built by [fr1kin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fr1kin), [Babbaj](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Babbaj), [Chunkr](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chunkr), [Henry](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Henry), [P529](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/P529) and [Sun_Wukon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sun_Wukon).

During the early months of 2017, Zltb strengthened his relationship with [ChromeCrusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ChromeCrusher). Together they formed a small base although little construction took place and the project was eventually abandoned. However, [ChromeCrusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ChromeCrusher) was well-versed in coordinate exploits and provided Zltb with code as well as an instructions to find base using natural terrain. Additionally, [ChromeCrusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ChromeCrusher) provided Zltb with the coordinates to [TheCampingRusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher)'s one million base, which was re-griefed by Zltb in March 2017.  He subsequently went inactive, playing intermittently before rejoining in 2025 to travel to the [World border](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/World_border).

### r/2b2t_Uncensored
After being banned by Hausemaster from r/2b2t on several accounts, Zltb launched a subreddit called [r/2b2t_uncensored](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/R%2F2b2t_Uncensored). This reddit became widely popular in the 2b2t community with support from well-known players such as [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86). Growth was slow but continuous over the following years.

In December 2019, the subreddit was involved in a drama with the main subreddit when [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) banned all moderators of the subreddit from the main subreddit. Notably, [HermeticLock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HermeticLock) left the moderator team to be instated in the main subreddit. Sato86 posted a strongly worded response to Hausemaster on his YouTube channel, effectively doubling down on his support for Zltb and r/2b2t_uncensored. Zltb and r/2b2t_uncensored faced their first major drama brought upon them when chat logs containing former moderator [SoiledCold](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SoiledCold) speaking negatively about how effective Zltb's moderation abilities were and proposing to gain more power and coup the subreddit, were leaked. This resulted in Soiled being demoted, although he was reinstated after "careful consideration" the next day. The second drama involved Mrck10, another former moderator, who went on a rampage and deleted almost every post. The subreddit was eventually fully restored. Following the removal of Zltb's wiki page, major disagreements arose between him and [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) as well as [SoiledCold](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SoiledCold). In January 2021, the subreddit was nuked by [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut), [Orsond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Orsond), [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013), and others. The initial raid was made possible by [Chezhead](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chezhead) who Zltb had brought on in an attempt to establish stable leadership. The raids continued two more times but the subreddit was fully restored shortly thereafter. Zltb continues to moderate the subreddit, despite controversy, later also adding many members from [Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column) to the staff team.

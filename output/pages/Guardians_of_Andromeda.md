**Guardians of Andromeda** was primarily a building group created by TheBabyGhast in October of 2020. The group ran until April 15th, 2024 where BG shut down operations due to inactivity.
## History
**Guardians of Andromeda's** main objective was to make beautiful base named after celestial objects. At the groups peak of activity they boasted a member count of 30. However this number would taper down to 20 towards the New Year of 2021. GoA made use of recruitment waves to quickly asses player building skill and trustworthiness, this also allowed them to quickly grow their repertoire of bases.

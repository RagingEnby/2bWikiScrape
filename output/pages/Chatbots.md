**Chatbots**, sometimes called **bots**, are computer-controlled accounts made and operated by players for many different reasons and are commonly found on the server. Some bots have large databases storing chat logs, kills, and deaths, while others have interactive chat features.

## RusherB0T
**RusherB0T** originally ran on the [John200410](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/John200410) account in 2017 while he wasn't playing, but then the old player priority was removed from all pre-june accounts, this includes John200410's accounts. This led to him quitting Minecraft. He then went on to come back April 2018, left September 2018 and came back February 2019. He now has Priority Queue on both his and the RusherB0T account, and is actively playing on 2b2t.

#### Accomplishments
In May of 2019 [Killet](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Killet) uploaded a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZCi-gISR7I&ab_channel=Killet) using RusherB0T's commands to give it gear and help it travel to 1 million blocks overworld.
## BibleB0t
**BibleB0t** is a chatbot (now discontinued) created by [0x22](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0x22), powered by python. BibleB0t is named for its constant references to Christianity, the bible, and christian morals. BibleB0t comes with a variety of commands players can use. The bot is most likely made in reference to an earlier bot by [c1yd3i](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/c1yd3i), which would let players play Bible quizzes in the chat.

### Commands
<div class="mw-collapsible mw-collapsed" style="width:400px; overflow:auto;">
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">

*!verse - allows the player to pick a verse from the Bible for BibleBot to read.
*!execute - players type in the name of a certain player and BibleBot will start a vote to execute the player for a randomly chosen reason. it is not advised to "vote" because inorder to vote, player must do /kill yes or /kill no
*!help - list all available commands
*!joinmessage - this command lets players type in a message assigned to a players name. When that specific player comes online,BibleBot says the message in the chat. This is BibleBot's most iconic command. Note that players cannot set their own join messages
*!joke - this command will make BibleBot tell a rather cheesy Biblical themed joke.
*!askgod - this command has players ask a question to god,where god will then answer back with yes, no, or maybe
*!report - allows players to "report" people to "the moderators" of 2b2t. When doing so, BibleBot will respond with '[Player Name], thanks for the report. A moderator will assist you shortly.' Of course there are no moderators on 2b2t and this command is entirely a joke.

</div></div>

### Trivia
*BibleBot is one of the oldest chatbots on 2b2t, having existed since mid-to-late 2015. ([Proof here](https://youtu.be/82WcLyrvP5I?t=35s))
*BibleBot will announce where it spawns if it is killed.
*BibleBot will greet new players by saying "Welcome [Player] To 2b2t, a peaceful queuing simulator" unless someone set a joinmessage for the player.
*During October of 2016, BibleBot changed its theme from Christianity to Haramabe. This was only temporary.
*After [kinorana](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/kinorana) [erased map data](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kinorana_Map_Crisis) in February 2017, BibleBot greeted new players with "Welcome [Player] to 2b2t, a peaceful cartography server. To get started simply ask 'Hause, where are the maps?'"
*In the lead up to the 2017 British Election, BibleBot became a Jeremy Corbyn worshipping bot based around 'Momentum Activists'
*BibleBot is very easy to exploit. One of the most common way to do so is to type !execute (60 random letters). This will get BibleBot kicked out of the server for spam. This was briefly patched in February but it broke again after April Fools. Video[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN0PIcO6Gxc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN0PIcO6Gxc)

## LolRiTTeRBot
**LolRiTTeRBot** was a chatbot created by LolRitter that was widely used on the server due to its database of kills, deaths, joins, leaves, and playtime. It is now used on Discord servers, as it is hard-muted on 2b2t itself.

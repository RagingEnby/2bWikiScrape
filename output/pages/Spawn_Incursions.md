{{Incursion}}
**Spawn Incursions,** also known as **Incursions,** **Spawn Occupations,** or **Spawn Invasions,** initially proposed by [hinderjd](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/hinderjd), are invasions of spawn by a community based group in which the group attempts to hold spawn for a period of time, slaughter enemies, kill newfags, and mostly get attention and fame (AKA clout). They were implemented from the beginning of the server's development, from 2013, to 2020. Currently, there has been 10 incursions of spawn. The first three incursions were all started by [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria), while the 4th was started by [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013), the 5th was started by [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids) and jared2013, the 6th was started by [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86), the 7th was started by [_Henry_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_Henry_), the 8th was started by [Armorsmith](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith) and [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013), the [Purge](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Purge) was started by [policemike55](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/policemike55), and the 10th was started by [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut). Their reasons are different, but they are united by the idea of ​​coming to the rescue and finding a solution to the problem that arose in a certain group.

## Classification
The classification of incursions is subject to interpretations. Different groups of society classify them differently, which causes problems with their calculation. However, there is a stable consensus regarding the first seven incursions.

Chronologically, the eighth should be the so-called [The Purge](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Purge), but after that event, the event instigated by [Armorsmith](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith) and [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) was called the [eighth](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Eighth_Incursion), and The Purge received the ninth number. Thus, a deviation in the order occurred. In addition, there are groups of people who do not recognize some invasions as incursions. In particular, the famous YouTuber [FitMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FitMC) is of this opinion. Because of this, the last incursions have been repeatedly criticized and are not recognized by everyone.

However, considering the main features of this event - the invasion of the spawn by members of a given group, carrying out various actions to prevent some process that they oppose (mainly the expected wave of newcomers due to YouTubers), it is more acceptable to recognize all ten incursions, as well as to deviate from the classification of the eighth and ninth incursions due to the fact that they are more known to the public in the wrong way.

## Incursion Groups & Policies
Incursion groups are meant to be separate entities from any other group. Since Incursions are considered to be community events and are meant to unite the community, members tend to ignore any hostile relations that their groups may have with others to work together for a common goal. While it may cause infighting, the incursions with several large groups involved have mostly been able to cooperate, at least until a certain period of time passed.

## Forward Operation Bases
Forward Operation Bases (FOB for short) are bases built by members of the incursion as foothold bases around spawn during an incursion. These bases are mainly used by the players in order to rest, repair armor, set spawn points, re-stack on food and gear, etc. They can vary from being small bases made of cobble to large monster bases made of rare and luxurious blocks. Currently, FOB's are usually being made out of pure obsidian following the construction of Wrath Outpost. Doing this is supposed to make FOB's look intimidating and sustain structure over long periods of time to act as "permanent marks" on the server due to obsidian being able to sustain a lot of damage.

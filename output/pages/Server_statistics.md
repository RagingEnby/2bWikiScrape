There are not many server statistics available to players. Despite its popularity, the information is sparse and currently there are no coordinated efforts to collect available information in one place. Please see the [Talk page](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Talk:Server_stats) if you wish to help.

What is available to us:

* official map size and player count updates (infrequent and rare)

* online player count

* online players

* queue numbers / queue time

* ping/connectivity

* chat logs

* minimap/world download files to estimate visited areas / changes over time

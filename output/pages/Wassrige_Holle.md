**Wässrige Hölle** was a Nether base built around a single illegal water source block. "Wässrige Hölle" is German for "Watery Hell"
## History
The base was founded by LordKai1 and Phi_Phi on 8/1/19 after getting the coordinates to the water source block above the Nether roof from _Courier6_. The pair made tunnels in the Nether ceiling that drained into open Nether, creating many waterfalls all throughout the base. With the waterfalls, they were able to grow trees, wheat and other crops, and created a few buildings.

Less then a week later,  _Courier6_, Gsmack, and 4Pilot traveled to the base. They planned to use a redstone machine created by ThebesAndSound to bring the water source block to Nether spawn and flood it. After Hausemaster disabled the Nether roof, they griefed the base on 8/8/19.

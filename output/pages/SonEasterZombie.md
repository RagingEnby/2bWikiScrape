**SonEasterZombie** (often called **SEZ**) is the founder and former leader of [The Society](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Society). He also has ran the [2b2t Census](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Society#Censuses), and created multiple other 2b2t surveys he's shared on the [subreddit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/subreddit).

## History
### Early History
SonEasterZombie joined 2b2t in June 2016 after watching [TheCampingRusher's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) video "THE OLDEST SERVER IN MINECRAFT", and having  wanted a completely vanilla server to play on. Getting out of spawn on his first try, he walked north in the [Overworld](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Overworld) until he found grass, farmed food, and built a small base 8k from spawn. He stayed there several days before making another base 26k out (called Flower Base).

Getting bored of playing alone, he decided to ask people in chat if they wanted to base with him, causing [Kurt](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kurt) to be invited to the base. After Kurt came, he built an autofisher and trolled SEZ by releasing many chickens at the base, causing SEZ to leave the base. Still not using the nether, he walked on the overworld highway and started a short-lived base called '16-Bit Base' (as a reference to the base's coordinates), and another unnamed base where he started the small group [Prelude](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Prelude).

With the addition of the queue in late June 2016 and TPS hovering around 4, interest in the server declined among the members of Prelude. Most of the other base members stopped logging on one day, and soon Kurt robbed the base and went his own way, causing the end of the group

### Return to 2b2t
In early November 2016, SonEasterZombie returned to 2b2t, left his base, and returned to Spawn. Zombie met [The_Grand_Lotus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Grand_Lotus) on his alt d00pedbedrock. Lotus explained [Highland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highland) to SEZ, offered him supplies, and brifly brought him into the group. They wandered around at spawn for a bit, eventually finding [EvoRulz](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/EvoRulz) and [Maxtorcd55's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Maxtorcd55) spawn base. SEZ eventually left the group due to disagreements stemming from Lotus's concerned that SEZ could be an insider from the [[Spawnmasons], and also as a result of Lotus' constant spamming in chat.
After leaving Highland, SEZ started the base [Castle Kristallnacht](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Castle_Kristallnacht). Afterwards, he participated in a spawnbase with [HappySeniorMan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HappySeniorMan), [Natester101](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Natester101), [Alkahest_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Alkahest_), [_iwo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_iwo), and [Sudofox](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sudofox) which was griefed shortly thereafter by [Pekee](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pekee). The group there later became [The Society](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Society), which he ran for several years in its efforts of collecting data on 2b2t through surveys, censuses, observation, and otherwise. He quit 2b2t in 2019 before briefly returning in April 2022.

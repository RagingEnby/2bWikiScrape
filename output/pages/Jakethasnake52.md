## History
Jakethasnake joined the server in June 2019. Jake watched content by [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit), [SalC1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SalC1) and [EtikaWNetwork](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/EtikaWNetwork) and was in his own words 'attracted to Fits masculinity'. Late 2019 Jake joined [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium) through [MAC_TONIGHT_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MAC_TONIGHT_) but soon got involved in conflicts and was eventually banned.

### YouTube career
In January 2020, Jake started his 2b2t-focused YouTube channel where he would regularly stream, host interviews with known 2b2t players, and talk about server developments and exploits in an exaggerated manner. Jake mostly focussed on base-hunting and PvP'ing, even founding his own group called the Snake Platoon. Jake would also start creating 2b2t related songs, including Dupe Griefer  and Dupe Stash Hero . In January 2020, Jake reached the Eastern World Border live on stream.

During the COVID-19 pandemic Jake would develop a unique 2b2t career, becoming known for his odd character and behavior and extremely long streams. In July 2020 Jake started a stream that ended up going on for a month and included him sleeping and eating. During his basehunting streams Jake stumbled upon multiple bases and stashes, most notably a 20,000 dub dupe stash.

Jake would also become infamous for spamming advertisements for his content, falsely copyright striking videos critical of him, threatening fellow players, raging on streams and in voice chats, and showing overall odd behavior. As a result, he would often be hunted by other players and would get his bases and stashes leaked and destroyed.

### Controversies
Jake deleted his YouTube channel in mid-January after a controversy surrounding his conduct on stream where he exposed his genitals on camera. Although Jake claimed it was an accident, the incident motivated many community members to criticize and outcast Jake. It also led to the creation of a meme called 'Jballs', with even a group taking on the name. Soon afterward Jake lost his base and stashes when his friend Rob leaked the coordinates, which caused him to leave the server for about a month. He later restored his channel and continued his activities.

On August 19th 2021 Jake showed his genitals on stream again. Soon thereafter Jake faced an angry crowd in a public Discord call for multiple hours and eventually faked committing suicide. He disappeared again for days while spreading fake news-stories about his alleged suicide. This incident was covered in the fourth edition of the [2b2t Times](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Times). Since then Jake has occasionally returned to the server, although he would be less active than before. In July 2022 Jake appeared on the DigCast to discuss his experiences on the server, including the mental and physical problems he experienced, and to apologize for his behaviour in the past.

On July 13, 2023, Jake was involved in a scamming incident where he sold a fake dupe to several players on the server. This led to further backlash from the community, with many accusing Jake of taking advantage of newer players who were unaware of his reputation. The incident further tarnished his image, causing even more players to distance themselves from him. Despite the controversy, Jake attempted to downplay the situation, but his credibility within the community suffered another significant blow.

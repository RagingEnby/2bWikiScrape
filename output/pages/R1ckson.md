**R1ckson** is a content creator, collector and explorer that has built with the Graybeard Geezers, [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate) and [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood).

## History
### Early History
R1ckson (pronounced Rickson, named after legendary fighter Rickson Gracie) first joined in September 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown. It was his first time playing Minecraft. He was able to quickly escape spawn and find some gear, before joining his first newfag group, [Group22](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Group22), and creating his first small base.

He started posting images of his finds in the wiki discord, where he met [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut), who invited him to join the [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate). With them, R1ckson participated in his first group base, [Gaza](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate#Gaza), where he constructed a pyramid often joked about by members of the group (after getting confused with Giza). It was his first ever real build in Minecraft, and was made extremely difficult due to [No Server November](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/No_Server_November) 2020.

R1ckson joined the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) in 2021, participating in the group bases [Vega](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#The_First_base) and [Menegroth](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Formative_bases), before taking a break from the group and building after the grief of these bases and Gaza in quick succession took its toll on him. He later returned to the group to build at [New Lugdunum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/New_Lugdunum).

In early 2021, R1ckson participated in [Forceken's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Forceken) so-called 'underground railroad' event, while escorting [sex](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/sex) out of spawn after having talked them into joining 2b2t.

On the 5th Anniversary of [Rusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) joining 2b2t, R1ckson travelled to the location of Rusher's first base, [Paradise](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Paradise), cleared the lavacasts, killed all withers, and rebuilt it, hosting an event there shortly after.

R1ckson spends the majority of his time searching for bases, stashes, collectables, and historical ruins on the server. He became less active in 2022 after the COVID-19 lockdown finally came to an end. In 2022 he had the 10th highest amount of [signed books](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Signed_Books) archived in the Signed Books and Collectibles community.

### Current activities
In 2023 he became more active again after joining the Graybeard Geezers, and built at several of their bases including [Geezer Town 6](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Geezer_Town_6).

He also started streaming more regularly, including 2b2t's first ever charity stream where he attempted to base hunt for 24 hours straight. He lasted over 15 hours, found 30 bases, and raised over $300 for Stand Up To Cancer.

In February of 2024 he released the "Complete Guide to 2b2t", a 17 minute video containing all the basic advice someone would need to get started on the server.

In the first half of 2024 his YouTube channel has seen rapid growth from 400 subscribers to 9,000 due to finding a new live stream exploit to gain many more live viewers than a channel of his size usually gets. This has been dubbed the **"viewer dupe"** by some. Especially since the amount of viewers will claim he is hacking while streaming, while everyone who watches him regularly just knows it's glitches and his gaming chair. This exploit and the audience participation in chat has also allowed him to grow a Discord server to over 1000 members and his YouTube channel to over 20k Subscribers.

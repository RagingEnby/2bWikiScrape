**Block Game Mecca** (often shortened to **BGM**) was a base founded on January 1, 2017, and griefed on June 1, 2018. At the time, it was considered one of the largest bases on [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t), although it was later surpassed by [Mu](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mu) and subsequently others. After its grief, many of the builds there were determined to be schematics which became one of a series of episodes attaching social stigma to using unoriginal schematics. Its grief also served to start the [BoeMeccan Witch Trials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BoeMeccan_Witch_Trials).
## History
### Foundation
Block Game Mecca was founded on January 1, 2017, by [GanjMeisterBlock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/GanjMeisterBlock) and [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids). Most of the original base members were selected from [C4RTM4N's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/C4RTM4N) shortlived [2b2t Creative Mode Project](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Creative_Mode_Project), which brought many players together from a variety of places which included the former group [Invictus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Invictus) and the base [Eastmarch](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Eastmarch). BGM started slowly, due to its distance and the lack of a travel exploit at the time, many members took months to arrive. A goldfarm was constructed early, but most of the initial efforts went into creating the so-called Industrial District, which was centered around a guardian farm. Once that was complete, the sorting system and the UFO (circular spike building near goldfarm) were built. Not long after those were constructed, the donkey dupes became public. The members of BGM immediately began work on many builds, such as the cathedral, and Ganjmeisterblock's gunpowder farm.

### Addition of Members
Block Game Mecca had a "trickle" invitation system. The members found that long periods of peacetime exhausted players, and accordingly had several-month long gaps between inviting players. Invitations were generally handed out every 3â€”6 months, with only one or two people being recruited at a time, and only those being added who received unanimous approval from the base's current members.

### Convict Island
Near the end of the base, several of the members ([GVNewman](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/GVNewman), [macca_2508](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/macca_2508), and [Vertrix](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vertrix), among others) thought it would be humorous to build an entirely new mini-base away from the rest of BGM without the knowledge of the rest of the members, and with the idea to see how long they could build there undiscovered by the other members. After several weeks undiscovered, they informed the rest of the base, and turned the area into a large collaborative project that resulted in a big last bought of activity at the base.

### Grief and BoeMeccan Witch Trials
The downfall of BGM came with the last series of recruits. Out of a large list, [doctrzombie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/doctrzombie), [Todarac](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Todarac), and [Beardler](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Beardler) were invited with the hopes of bringing more permanent activity to the base. Unbeknownst to the members of Block Game Mecca, Beardler been accidentally leaked the coordinates by Slappnbadkids, who had then subsequently leaked beardler's base [Oceania](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Oceania) trying to buy time for BGM to continue un-griefed a while longer. Beardler had suspected Slappnbadkids as the leaker of Oceania, and so decided to leak and grief BGM on an alt. He also coordinated with [Odorous](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Odorous) to steal all the items in [Drathader's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Drathader) museum. A short time after Beardler's arrival on June 1st, 2018, the museum was stolen and withered, and the center of the base was slightly damaged. Base members along with [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) concluded to self-grief the rest of the base. These events led to the [BoeMeccan Witch Trials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BoeMeccan_Witch_Trials), during which it was proven that Beardler had griefed Block Game Mecca (and also Boedecken), as well as that [RyRycat](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/RyRycat) had modified the base's world download hosted on [The Museum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Museum) in order to pose himself as having found and spared the base before its grief. All these events put together served to expose wrongdoing within the Museum and to spread both unknowingly false and harmful rumors about Beardler, as well to spread accountability concerning the grief of BGM & Boedecken, and the handling of world downloads on the part of the Museum. Following the grief of Block Game Mecca, the group moved to [Block Game Jerusalem](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Jerusalem).

### Copied builds controversy
After the fall of the base, [Ain](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ain) discovered that a sizeable portion of the builds present at the base were schematics taken from other sources than the base members themselves (largely, the popular *Minecraft* community content website [Planet Minecraft](https://www.planetminecraft.com/)). Ain posted his findings on the 2b2t subreddit which can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/9xtp6p/disappointingly_almost_all_of_the_principle/).

### Post-grief
Following the group's departure from the base, activity there did not entirely stop. [Sharkcaller](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sharkcaller) started a base in BGM's ruins in late 2018, where he had begun to repair grief damage with obsidian and built several maparts..

In May 2021, [oofplux](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/oofplux) and [Zeenyo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Zeenyo) had been exploring the ruins of BGM when the still-ungriefed Industrial district and its bulk duped carpet storage were discovered. Carpet dupers had been disabled for years by then, which made the carpets highly valuable for [Mapart](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mapart). They split the 200 double chests of shulker boxxed carpets, with much going to the [Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys), and the rest going to [t gang](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/t_gang) for its project [Mapopoly](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mapopoly), which became the largest mapart ever constructed at that time.

**Victoria** was a base built by [mattvtd](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/mattvtd) with contributions from [SurvivalGamerQC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SurvivalGamerQC), [Toysoildier](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Toysoildier), and [DistantFoSho](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DistantFoSho). The base was founded on February 14, 2018, and was griefed by jared2013 on November 25, 2019.

## History
On February 14, 2018, mattvtd founded Victoria, which he started as a solo project until he eventually invited some others to build at the base and visit. It was a large town situated in a savanna biome near a flower forest with a large, central throne room. Some other builds included a floating fountain, a large mushroom build, and a wheat field with a windmill.

The base was found at least once by traveling players, but was griefed by jared2013, who got the base's coordinates through [Nocom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nocom).

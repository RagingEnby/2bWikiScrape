## 2b2t Server Archive
After the [BoeMeccan Witch Trials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BoeMeccan_Witch_Trials), an older server known as [The Museum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Museum) was shut down due to security concerns related to how builds were stored and administrative corruption. In order to continue hosting a place where users can visit previously destroyed [bases](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/bases), Terbin founded [The Archive (server)](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Archive_(server)) and assumed the position as the sole administrator around August 2019. The Archive hosts hundreds of builds from 2b2t, and began accepting submissions from [Constantiam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Constantiam) (a similar, popular anarchy server). Terbin has continued to update the server throughout the years and is widely trusted amongst the 2b2t community.

**EddyNoChong** is a builder. He is notable for his very relaxed and friendly personality which has led to his involvement in many groups and bases.

## History
### Early History
**EddyNoChong**, also known as Eddy, developed a keen interest in 2b2t, after watching FitMC's coverage of the Infinity Incursion water cube and lava wall. He would join the server in 2022, alongside his brother, RememberingXD. They faced many challenges escaping spawn, resorting to afk fishing to gather resources for their initial temporary base. With the assistance of a player named megabase, Eddy successfully navigated through spawn. Bored with the routine, he sought out building groups in 2b2t and connected with [BachiBachBach](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BachiBachBach) on the 2b2t Archive Server, who provided recommendations.

### DonFuer
In July 2022, Eddy met with [Osmobyte](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Osmobyte) and was invited to join [Donfuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer). His contributions included notable builds at **Don Tour** and **Don Myr**. Don Tour, featured on the DonFuer YouTube channel as the "MOST DIVERSE BASE ON 2B2T"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esZr3x2KZ9o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esZr3x2KZ9o) showcased Eddy's talent in constructing farms, the Nether region, and the aurora borealis. Following Don Tour's griefing by [Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys), Eddy joined Don Myr, a medieval-style base. Despite Don Myr's unfortunate self-griefing due to leaks, Eddy was promoted to the ranger rank. In February 2023, university commitments led Eddy to take a break from 2b2t, ultimately retiring from DonFuer in mid-February 2023 to explore new building experiences.

### Cakemasons
Eddy remained active in 2b2t's Discord community and joined the [Cakemasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cakemasons) in October 2022 at the invitation of Kizzycocoa. Known as "The VC recorder," Eddy playfully embraced his reputation for recording voice chats. During breaks from 2b2t, he collaborated with the group on projects in the Constantiam Server.

### Astral Brotherhood
In February 2023, Eddy returned to 2b2t and joined the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) after approaching [Osmobyte](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Osmobyte) and [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut). His involvement spanned bases like Aurorian, Fort Concord, and Spawn Migration 2. Aurorian, a futuristic-medieval hybrid, showcased Eddy's skills in constructing an underground farm lair. Despite the base's self-griefing in March 2023, Eddy continued contributing to Spawn Migration 2, which unfortunately met the same fate in August 2023.

In August 2023, Eddy was invited by [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) to rebuild Fort Concord[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0klsQ73lDZw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0klsQ73lDZw), a historic spawn base, achieving record player counts before its eventual griefing by Fifth Column.

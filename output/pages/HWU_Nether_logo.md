The HWU Nether logo was a Spawn logo constructed by the [Highway Workers Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Workers_Union).

## History
On March 9th 2022 the Highway Workers Union finished its sixth major project: the construction of a massive Nether logo. The project was similar to the many ‘sky logo’s’ around spawn, be it that this one would not be easily visible to players. The logo was 10,000 by 10,000 blocks in size and required over 28 million blocks of obsidian. It was built at Y-level 119, requiring the removal of over 56 million blocks of netherrack. It mostly covered the entire region dug free earlier by the [Nether Roof Freedom Project](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nether_Roof_Freedom_Project) in 2019 and 2020. The logo was finished on March 9th 2022, surpassing [The Masonic Eclipse](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Masonic_Eclipse) by only around 15,000 blocks of obsidian.

|groups=[Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria)}}{{Incursion}}{{Stub}}**II Incursion** or **2nd Incursion** or **The Second Incursion** occurred in August 2013. It was also the longest incursion to date. The goal of the Incursion was the same: occupy the spawn and kill everyone. During 2 months members of [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria) was killing everyone and destroying the [spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/spawn).
{{Caption|Yes, this one was even messier than the first. The Second Incursion was marked by the lack of organization and surprising collaboration between the players involved. Unlike the first one, everyone's goals were the same: occupy spawn and kill everyone you see. Some of its (good) standards would become a reference for the third one. It happened after Belegost, the base that was supposed substitute Valkyria was accidentally leaked by Coldwave when he used Adolf client. This scattered the Valkyrians a lot. Some came with me to Rhadamantis, but some didn’t. Tired of running, some people went to their solo bases or friends.

Soon after Rhada, I stopped playing for a few months. I returned to 2b2t in August and was immediately invited by Pyrobyte to come to spawn and join this new invasion that was going on. 2b2t players numbers increased by this IGN post where 2b2t's spawn was considered one of the 6 greatest wonders of Minecraft. This motivated some veterans and Valkyrians to take arms and go to spawn to get some “fresh meat”.

The Second Incursion base started as a dirt hut built by Fubster. A few days later, a whole base took shape and served as a foundation for the impressive 2 months and half of occupation. Fubster, Pompano, Pyrobyte and I were the captains and administrators. We built roads, bases and beacons. But all of these improvements were used to maximize the killing and make it easier to patrol all directions. We would judge who was worthy or not to join the event.

The fact is that the second incursion was a genocide of newcomers. It brutally broke the players income and gave them a taste of how awful 2b2t can be. New players would be stalked and killed all day, every day. Week after week. Some earned our mercy, but most didn’t.

At the time, I considered it fun, but looking back now, I see that this incursion might have made a disservice to 2b2t by eliminating a chance of 2b2t to get more regular players from the IGN advertising. The few that decided to stay after being killed and persecuted at those times, remember those days with a bitter taste. I know this because some today are my friends. This  Is an external link to the video in question that dropped Jun 20th 2013. I joined (Docsmurf) as the direct result of this video and was able to escape spawn and set up a temp base around 60K before the bulk of the Second incursion landed]

The only good act we did back there was defend NFE from newfag raids and potential griefers. Thousands of new players were killed according to estimates.

However, something good came up from this Incursion. It made possible the rebuilding of Valkyria by reuniting the crew again and even adding more people to it. The base wouldn’t shine again and become a legend without all the death and mayhem we caused at Spawn.

The Second Incursion was a necessary evil.}}

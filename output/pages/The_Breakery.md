**The Breakery** is a group, made by [OffeeX](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/OffeeX) with the intention of destroying bedrock and end portals. Also known for development of Bloomware client.

## History
One day OffeeX was told there is a way to break bedrock on 2b2t, so he soon came up with idea to create group in order to get more players involved in projects.

## The Last Bedrock Project
The Last Bedrock was a project that about destroying all illegal bedrock (as well as every end portal) on 2b2t, although the project actually pre-existed the creation of the Breakery.
In the mid of July [Bananch1k_YT](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bananch1k_YT) had started removing Bedrock Dam at the [ZiggyBase](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ZiggyBase), and on 26 July of 2021 the Bedrock Dam was fully removed.
After the destruction of the Bedrock Dam, Bananch1k_YT messaged OffeeX in discord to tell him. Offeex decided to continue the bedrock breaking.

The next day the Breakery started removing all public end portals , and by the 4th of August they finished.
They spent the next few days removing every public illegal bedrock.

## The Eternal Name Project
After concluding the 'so-called' 'Last Bedrock' project, OffeeX decided the next project was to carve his name into the natural bedrock at 200,0 in the [Overworld](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Overworld).
The project took two days, and had over 10 participants. The most active participants were:
* [Terpila](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Terpila) (rockeZZergon's alt)
* [zzeekk_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/zzeekk_)
* [SoMkAt_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SoMkAt_)
On 20 August 2021, the project was concluded.

## Bloomware client
A hacked client created by DiOnFire and OffeeX, with contributions from cattyn and Rikonardo, was in active development for the latest Minecraft versions. It offered both a free (lite) and premium versions. However, a rift developed between DiOnFire and OffeeX after some time. According to DiOnFire, the conflict was rooted in the Ukraine war and OffeeX's alleged russophobia, though no specific reason was given. Following this, DiOnFire left the project. The Bloomware website subsequently went offline, and on August 12, 2023, the source code for the latest Bloomware version was made public and archived. In the README file of the repository, OffeeX described the client as the latest development, highlighting its connection to 2b2t.

}}**The Lands of Norphs and Niggers**, also known simply as **The Lands**, was a base founded by [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa). It lasted for years due to its distance from spawn.

## History
After losing his End base when Hause closed the End in 2012, [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa) decided to travel out to {{Coordinates|-10000000|-10000000}} overworld using the Nether roof, which was enabled at the time. He got bored after about a week of travelling, however, and decided to stop at {{Coordinates|-4400000|-4400000}} and create a base.

Jack created one of the server’s first beacon arrays at his new base shortly after the server updated to 1.4. He lived alone at this base for months until December 2012, when [SnackyNorph](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SnackyNorph), who had just lost his [library](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Snacky%27s_Library), asked to base with Jack. When Snacky arrived at The Lands, he brought [ExaltedSpartan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ExaltedSpartan), [xarviar](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xarviar), [stupidwalrus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/stupidwalrus), and [AWarGuy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AWarGuy) with him. Snacky also gave the base a name; “The Lands of Norphs and Niggers”, usually shortened to just “The Lands”. Due to the sheer amount of time it took to travel to the base, new arrivals came in waves. A second wave of players in October 2013 included [kinorana](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/kinorana), [Branillon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Branillon), [Parthicus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Parthicus), [thePOMPANO](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/thePOMPANO), [fubster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fubster) and [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan).

Over time, many of the residents of The Lands grew bored and /killed their way back to spawn. One day, Jack was using a teleportation exploit known as STP, which sent him to spawn and rendered him unable to return to The Lands. Soon afterwards, Jack joined the [Third Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Third_Incursion) and [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria), and didn’t return to The Lands for an extended period of time. When he did, he used an exploit to ride horses on the Nether roof, since the roof was now supposed to be inaccessible. Even with this exploit, it still took him four days of riding to reach The Lands again.

Many players visited The Lands over time, including [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2), [SilverKrownKing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SilverKrownKing), [CainesLaw](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CainesLaw), and [OreMonger](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/OreMonger). [TheCampingRusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) was even given a tour of the base by jared2013 after it was griefed, although Rusher was killed by Jacktherippa part of the way through.

## Destruction
[C4RTM4N](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/C4RTM4N) and [taylo112](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/taylo112) leaked BedTP to [Branillon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Branillon), so that he would build a bedchain for several members of The Lands to be able to get to the base. The idea was that C4RTM4N and taylo112 could then ride the bedchain to The Lands to grief it. The base members of The Lands broke the final bedlink when it was not in use, delaying the grief a considerable amount of time. iTristan had a falling out with the members of the base after his bed at the Lands was broken. He brought popbob into the griefing group, as she had followed Jack out to the location in 2013 after the grief of [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria_(Base)), and as a result had an account (RadicalHiccup) at The Lands. Popbob replaced the final link of the bedchain. [Jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) and taylo112 subsequently griefed The Lands, utilizing a [32k sword](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/32K_Weapons) from Tristan’s stash against the members of the base.

## Builds
### The Sky Temple of Autism
Jack began work on the temple in July 2013. The design was heavily influenced by a build on the Mindcrack server, by Zisteau, called "The Lens”. The Lens was made of sandstone, but Jack decided to use stone brick and quartz for his build, as he felt it was easier on the eyes and stone brick was easier to obtain in large quantities.

The Sky Temple of Autism featured small platforms connected to the main structure by iron bars, four beacons, and a stream of water running through it from top to bottom. It is made of stone brick and quartz, with accents of lapis blocks and glowstone used for lighting. The design of this build would greatly influence the design of Jack’s next major build, [Space Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_Valkyria).

### SnackyNorph's Tower of Autism
After arriving at The Lands, SnackyNorph built his so-called 'Tower of Autism' on February 2, 2013. It was mostly made out of snow, and housed multiple farms and a storage area. A plane was built crashing into the tower by xarviar a year later, symbolizing 9/11. Snacky also built a cube shaped house next to the tower.

### Taj M'Autist
ExaltedSpartan built the so-called 'Tak M'Autist' after returning to The Lands with Jack following the Third Incursion. It was a large structure mostly out of quartz. The interior was never finished, and neither were the surrounding buildings. The name and design are based on the [Taj Mahal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taj_Mahal).

### Other builds
When he first arrived at what would become The Lands, Jack walled off a desert village to protect it from mobs. Over time, transformed and expanded the village into the central area of the base. He converted the village blacksmith building into a multi-story house and created multiple farms surrounding it, including a gold farm that went down to bedrock, an iron farm, and multiple automatic crop farms.

A large pyramid of blue stained glass filled with water with a beacon in the center was built by Jack in early 2014.

Fubster and thePOMPANO built The 2b2t Fish and Wildlife Corps H.Q at the base after their arrival. It consisted of a small cabin with a secret “vault” made of rainbow wool containing a pink swastika underneath it.

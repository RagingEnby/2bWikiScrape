|date_griefed=June 1, 2018
|date_started=September 20, 2016}}**Equilibrium** was a base founded on September 20th, 2016 by [c3rv3z4](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/c3rv3z4). It was quickly discovered by the YouTuber [Mines](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mines), who made [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0fVNBVnpAo) about it. c3rv3z4 initially recruited mainly German 2b2t players, the first ones being [Fabustra](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fabustra) and [Prismary](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Prismary). Over time more and more players were invited, until the base was griefed on June 1, 2018 by [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) as the last base in his [31days31griefs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/31days31griefs) month of destruction.

## Buildings
### Community Building
Originally intended to be c3rv3z4's house, the increase of players in the base quickly caused it to become a central hub with large tunnel systems and a sorting system underground. Being the oldest building in the base, it went through a lot of revisions throughout its lifespan.

### Creeper Head
The creeper head was one of the oldest buildings of the base and went through almost no revisions since it was built by c3rv3z4 not long after he founded the base. Before the Equilibrium Logs got moved into the community building, this was its usual location and the notification hub.

### Stable
The stable served as a place to breed cattle and get their drops from. It was later removed in order to make room for future projects.

### Aztec Temple / Spleef Arena
Built in a few days after the invitation of Fabustra, the Aztec Temple was one of the most notable builds in the entire base until the very end.

### Shulker Patrol Tower
Fabustra's second large-scale project, built to waste resources. It was later repurposed to be the HQ of the Shulker Patrol, which consisted of a few basemates who were picking up abandoned shulker boxes at spawn.

### Wheat-Fields
A tribute to the Valley of Wheat by Est_Miyamae. It consisted of a large field of wheat and a wooden tower in the center.

### "Happy Treefriend" Map Art
The Treefriend Map Art was one of the first [map arts](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Map_Art) made after the first map reset by Prismary and Fabustra. It often served as a pearl spot for short trips to Spawn. It was one of the reasons Prismary and MiningMinecraft started talking about map art and later worked with a few more players to found the Map Artists of 2b2t community.

### "Silica" Map Art (Part 1)
The first and only part of the Silica map art, which was never finished. Prismary made a reddit post about the project.

### Giganox' Forest
When Giganox arrived, he started construction on his forest. It mainly consisted of Housetrees, his signature building.

### Est's Castle
The second and final project by Est_Miyamae. The castle was never finished, even though she worked on it every time she logged onto the server.

### Museum
As the base members got their hands on more and more artifacts, Fabustra constructed a museum building, replacing a very small room which had been part of the community building. Before the interior was finished, the 1.12 Stacking Dupe happened and the place was used for duping. Later the items were moved into one of the Twin Towers and organized there so the building could serve its original purpose again.

### Twin Towers
A replica of the Twin Towers mainly constructed by Fabustra and Giganox. One of the towers housed the base's Dupe Stash, the other one had a simple water based Mob Farm inside of it. There was a plan to build planes in front of it in order to celebrate 9/11 of 2018. Unfortunately, the base was griefed a few months before it would have taken place.

### Ravine-Library
A library built inside one of the base's naturally generated ravines made by Prismary. Later, a few brewing supplies were added into a side of the ravine.

### Bwankie's Tower
The only major build made by Bwankie, a futuristic tower mainly made out of quartz.

### Drollovitch's Cathedral
The Cathedral was a project by Drollovitch, who was the newest Equilibrium member at the time. Even though was never finished, it served as a great reminder of what beautiful buildings were still going to be made at Equilibrium.

### Lavacastle 2.0
A building by Giganox shaped like a rose, inspired from the original Lavacastle he built as a standalone base. It mostly used lavacasts to form its walls and was going to be hollow on the inside. The original has been made famous by several YouTubers, giving it the nickname Stone Rose.

### Dragun
The Clay Dragon named "Dragun" was one of the newest builds in the base. It was constructed by Fabustra and planned out by himself and Prismary only a few weeks prior to the grief.

### Beacon-Grid
The bacon network is a grid of beacons providing buffs in the entire base area. It was planned out and built by paulklee2000.

### osu! cube
The first and only project by NikReturns. It's a tribute to the popular rhythm game osu!.

### MOB (Middle of Base) Placeholder-Building
The MOB building was one of paulklee2000's only projects. It served as a placeholder for a large-scale building in the very center of the base. A red glazed Terracotta block that was at the very center of the building and marked the notorious coordinates survived the grief and is today marking the center of the new base.

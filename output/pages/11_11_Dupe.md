__STATICREDIRECT__h](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Duplication_Glitches) that occurred on November 11, 2016.

One of the major glitches in [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) history, it occurred when [RusherIsAutistic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/RusherIsAutistic) leaked an easy way to duplicate items, causing mass duping across the entire server. Many players who abused this glitch used it to duplicate double chests worth of enchanted apples and other rare items, crashing the 2b2t economy.{{Fact}}

## Glitch
The glitch involved dropping an item and instantly disconnecting from the server. When logging back in, the item would be both on the ground and in the player's inventory. At the time, it was the largest duplication glitch on the server, since an entire inventory worth of items could be duplicated at once.{{CiteGeneral|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cviD9SXJPm0 |title=2B2T MAJOR UPDATE: DUPE GLITCH, PLAYERS BACKDOORED, MAP LIMIT REACHED |accessdate=July 18, 2022 |author=[FitMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FitMC) |date=November 19, 2016 |publisher=YouTube}}

Another method of duping was found by the [4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4th_Reich); the 4th Reich employed a method that used two *Minecraft* windows, one for joining in the server, and the other for dropping the item.

The infamous trader [kinorana](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/kinorana) created a client to easily perform the glitch. The client, kinodupe, had the capability of duping an entire inventory worth of items at once. The client was backdoored, however, and people who duped using the client had their stashes leaked on the 2b2t subreddit. Cheat clients such as [Impact](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cheat_Clients#Impact) and [Wurst](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cheat_Clients#Wurst) were soon updated to add features capable of performing the glitch.

## Aftermath
The glitch was patched on November 28, 2016, when the server updated to 1.11.

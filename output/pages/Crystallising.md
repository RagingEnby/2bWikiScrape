**Crystallising** (Formerly known as **Crystalinqq**) and founder of [Team Coca-Cola](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Coca_Cola) and [Collector’s Club](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Collector%E2%80%99s_Club) is a prominent collector of [map art](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/map_art), banners, and most notably signed books. As of the time of writing, Crystallising is 2b2t’s largest signed book collector with over 22 Double-Chests of fully filled shulkers.

## History
Crystallising first joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) in early July 2016. He spent his first few weeks on the server gathering armor, tools, and weaponry. One day while traveling on the nether highway, Crystallising met [Niftyrobo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Niftyrobo). After conversing for a while, Niftyrobo recruited Crystallising into [Team Imperia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Imperia). Shortly after, the [11/11 Duplication Exploit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/11%2F11_Dupe) was discovered to the public. Team Imperia took advantage of this and duped large amounts of armour, tools, weapons, supplies, etc., giving Crystallising access to all he needed. After Team Imperia disbanded in December 2016, Crystallising briefly joined [Team Malaria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Malaria), leaving shortly after. Once Crystallising had left Team Malaria, alongside his friend [Flyinqq](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Flyinqq), Team Coca-Cola was founded, with other players such as [BarrenDome](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BarrenDome) joining the group. Crystallising also joined [The Last Templar](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Last_Templar) & [The Freelancers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Freelancers).

Crystallising avidly collected [map art](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/map_art), almost entirely completing his map art collection until the February 2017 [Kinorana’s Map Art Reset](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kinorana_Map_Crisis) wiped them all. From then on, Crystallising transitioned from collecting Map Art to [Signed Books](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Signed_Books), since they were not as temporary as maps at the time. Crystallising soon after created the 2b2t Signed Book & Collectibles Network Discord Server attracting thousands of players and becoming a central community hub which further helped him to expand his collection of signed books, and eventually amass one of the server’s most extensive signed book collection.

After 2019, Crystallising became increasingly inactive, although he still logs in periodically.

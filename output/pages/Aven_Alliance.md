}}**The Aven Alliance** is a private group that was founded by [KalebLP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KalebLP) and [Tilley8](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tilley8) in 2024, with the hopes of fostering a tight-knit community.

## History
The Aven Alliance was founded on August 1st, 2024, following [JimmyApe's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/JimmyApe) public [Rebuild Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rebuild_Base) event near overworld [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn). After the event abruptly ended, its contributors grew bored, leading to the decision to repurpose the stash of goods and building materials collected during the event to form a new building group. Thus, [KalebLP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KalebLP) and [Tilley8](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tilley8) officially established the group as the Aven Alliance.

### Adlertown
KalebLP and Tilley8 founded the first base, Adlertown, on August 2nd, 2024. The base was established shortly after the group's founding and prospered briefly, showcasing the group's initial efforts at building and collaboration. Adlertown was built within 100,000 blocks of spawn, and was located atop a mountain. The base featured a detailed medieval-style village, centered south of a giant stone archway constructed by [pxssixn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/pxssixn). Adlertown's success was short-lived, lasting only two days due to poor security measures. The decision to invite nearly everyone from the Rebuild Base event ultimately led to its downfall, as the influx of players made it vulnerable to griefing. Adlertown was ultimately griefed on August 4th, 2024.

### Vivelia
Vivelia was founded by KalebLP shortly after the grief of Adlertown, marking a fresh start for the Aven Alliance. The base was defined as a sprawling medieval-style village with several prominent structures, surrounded by houses and decorative structures. [gwr03](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/gwr03) was a major contributor of the base, having built over a dozen houses surrounding the central hill. Simultaneously, [physthius](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/physthius) designed a large central park for the base, complete with winding rivers, benches, and a striking Japanese-themed temple that added a distinctive flair to the build. Unlike its predecessor, Vivelia was established with greater care for security and member selection, enabling it to flourish as a stable and productive base. The base quickly became a centerpiece for the group, showcasing their building capabilities and establishing their presence on 2b2t. As Vivelia grew, the Aven Alliance caught the attention of notable 2b2t players, including [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) and [Nigerianprince](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nigerianprince). Recognizing the base's potential and aligning with the group's values, these players reached out, and were later welcomed into the Aven Alliance, as well as being invited to Vivelia. Members continued building at Vivelia for some time, steadily expanding the base. However, activity eventually began to decline as some members left 2b2t and others focused on different projects. Over time, the base became less active, marking the end of its primary era but leaving behind a significant chapter in the group's history. The base was discovered by a base hunter on October 15th, 2024, who later stole all of the base's resources and supplies. After discussions among the members, the group decided to self-grief the base on October 19th, bringing Viveliaâ€™s era to an official close.

### Avenfall
Avenfall, Aven Alliance's recruit base, was founded by KalebLP on August 31st, 2024. While KalebLP constructed the hub and pearl stasis chamber, he eventually returned to Vivelia to focus on upcoming projects. In his absence, [_Arisaka](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_Arisaka) emerged as the most active builder, contributing significantly by creating a train station, multiple houses, and motivating recruits to start building. Avenfall featured a variety of structures with diverse designs and colors as well as multiple pixel art builds displayed in the sky. The base was eventually discovered by two players who then proceeded to kill everyone who was online before griefing the base on November 1st, 2024.

### Recent History
After Avenfall was griefed, many members were left without a base and either shifted focus to other projects, became inactive, or left 2b2t entirely. Despite several attempts to revive the group, KalebLP closed applications on November 15th, 2024. The remaining members turned their attention to other endeavors, with some, including KalebLP, joining the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood). The Aven Alliance continues to operate with a small number of members, quietly maintaining bases and stashes on the server.

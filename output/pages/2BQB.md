}}**2BQB** is a group that botted the queue to make it harder for newer players to join and "shut down 2b2t for good."

## History
It started when [Exoram](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Exoram) and Soiled wanted to bot/ddos the server to make it harder to join and "shut down 2b2t for good." Alexattacker made the discord with Exoram and SoiledCold to better coordinate the botting. The discord was heavily advertised by iiGryxz and c0mmie which led to the discord reaching 300 members in a few days. As can clearly be seen by 2b2t's continued existence, this project failed to kill the server.

### Project Dardanus Flood
Project Dardanus Flood, named after [an old Greek myth about a great flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek_flood_myths#Dardanus), used Minebot to bot the queue.

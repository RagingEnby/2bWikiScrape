**Sun Knights** is a building group on 2b2t that was founded on February 18, 2022, by [CuppyK](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CuppyK). The group has gone through various bases, leadership changes, and distinct eras throughout its history.

## Early History (February 2022 - April 2022)
The group's first base, "Spawn Slak," was established around February 22, 2022. The initial recruit base, created on February 23, 2022, fell victim to an insider who griefed it on March 7, 2022. On the same day, the concept of "Golden Knights" was introduced to highlight the most active members, with the first Golden Knight being "slowpi."

A paper farm was constructed, initially accessible to only a few members. It lasted until October 15, 2022, before being discovered and griefed. Recruit Base 2, built shortly after, became one of the group's best bases and lasted about a month.

## Middle Period (May 2022 - October 2022)
The first members' base, "Blinkee Oasis," was established on March 16, 2022, and remarkably lasted until April 1, 2023. "Winter Beard," the second spawn base, was created on March 28, 2022, but ended up getting griefed after a party.

The group faced periods of inactivity during the summer, with little happening. However, on September 28, 2022, Recruit Base 10 became one of the best bases but was unfortunately griefed on October 15, 2022. Recruit Bases 11 and 12 faced similar fates shortly after.

R13, known as "Oolacile of the Abyss," was a unique underground base created on October 29, 2022, and abandoned on November 27, 2022. "Sunzy Castle," built on November 2, 2022, was meant for highly trusted members but was leaked and subsequently griefed.

## Decline and Leadership Changes (November 2022 - August 2023)
Xmas Fortress (R14) was established on November 27, 2022, but saw limited construction. The group's activity further declined, and subsequent bases like Sun Knights Workshop (R15) had little development due to decreasing activity.

On March 18, 2023, CuppyK stepped down as the leader, and [Pbg4444](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pbg4444) took over until August 18, 2023. "SunPolis" (R19) was created on March 4, 2023, but was griefed on April 5, 2023. "Sunlit Dunes 2" (R20) faced a similar fate, lasting only a week from April 7 to April 14, 2023.

## Recent History (August 2023 - Present)
Leadership changed again on August 18, 2023, with [Ashman](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ashman) and [aodrael](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/aodrael) taking over. Several attempts to revive the group occurred but were short-lived. The most recent base, R24, was abandoned after being leaked on the SalC1 Discord server.

In May 2024, CuppyK wanted the group to be revived, so he chose [Javikia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Javikia) to lead the group as he was one of the oldest members to still be active on 2b2t. Javikia brought in many of his friends from other groups to help revive activity in Sun Knights, and saw success with R25 and R26.

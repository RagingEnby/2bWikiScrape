}}**The Collective** is a project-oriented group based around the goal of creating a space for the more relaxed, mature and less toxic side of the community. The Collective aims to be anti-larp, which is why the group is modelled generically, prioritising in-game involvement and activity over status.

## History
### Origin
The Collective was founded on February 23rd, 2022 at 3 AM by the Collective's Council and Inner Circle. Previous to this they were members of [The Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Imperials), but increased distrust in higher leadership, past controversy and arduous infighting caused them to reconsider their future in the group. After it was decided it was better for them to leave, most of the current active member-base resigned en masse. The people that stayed within Imperials weren't happy about this as it meant that they had to rebuild their presence on 2b2t from scratch, even though [Toska](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Toska) and [ACABMichael](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ACABMichael) stayed behind to aid with making sure there was a smooth transition between power as the old leaders resigned and new ones were appointed. Certain higher-up Imperials became increasingly harder to work with so eventually the Collective had to break ties completely. The Imperials remained at odds with The Collective ever since.

## Projects and Events
### Project Collective Sky
#### Conception
Project Collective Sky was originally conceptualised by [penisballs22](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/penisballs22). Whilst a member Imperials in October of 2021, he created a poorly edited image of the Imperial Dragon logo on top of the [Masonic Eclipse](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Masonic_Eclipse) spawn logo. He proposed jokingly that the Imperials should create a spawn logo larger than the current largest one, so large in fact that it should completely cover up the 27 million obsidian logo built by the [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons). While this was impossible at the time, the members of Imperials settled on building a logo roughly 1.2 million obsidian large. This project was titled Project Imperial Sky, or PIS. After this first 1.2 million obsidian structure was completed, a second one was planned which would be the full size original idea. However the planning phase took a long time, and the members of Imperials that planned to construct this final version resigned before it could be launched.

#### Final Plan
When The Collective was created following this mass resignation, the project was changed to reflect the logo of the new group the members were a part of, and so the Imperial Dragon was discarded and replaced with an adapted version of the Collective logo. The project was renamed to Project Collective Sky.

#### FitMC Incident
In July of 2022, a player by the name of [oofplux](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/oofplux) approached the planners of Project Collective Sky and proposed to lie about the project's state at the time and wanted to create a story about how it was already in construction when oofplux found and griefed the project's main obsidian stash, which supposedly destroyed the project. The fabricated story was given to the 2b2t YouTuber [FitMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit), and subsequently appeared in his [video about oofplux's attempt to grief the spawn logos of 2b2t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIhgSccZ1OQ). This incident caused the Collective Sky project to be exposed to the 2b2t population well before it was planned to, making construction of the project more risky due to possible saboteurs. oofplux also vowed to (try to) stop this project when it finally reaches construction.

## History
### Imperials
Nigerianprince joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) in January 2022. He joined [The Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Imperials) several days after joining. He quickly rose in the groups ranks, becoming a co-leader along with [Xavier](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Xavier) after the previous group of leaders (as well as many of the members) left Imperials and started [The Collective](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Collective). Over the next few months, Nigerian and Xavier put the group back together and began to expand again After Xavier quit 2b2t in early June 2022, Nigerian became the main leader of the 2b2t branch of the group, called [Centurion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Imperials#Server_Ranks) within the group.

As the new centurion, Nigerian significantly expanded the group, started bases such as [Capital](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Capital), and conducted a wide variety of projects and events with the group (such as building a large moai statue near spawn). In October, Nigerian tired out from leading the group and stepped down for [Sleepyfemboy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sleepyfemboy) to become the new leader, although this was short lived as Sleepyfemboy suddenly stopped playing 2b2t. Nigerian ran the group for several more months but became increasingly frustrated due to the increasing conflict among the group leadership, which caused him to fully exit the group in February 2023 along with many close friends, with whom he started [Outlast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Outlast).

### Outlast
[Outlast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Outlast) is a private building group founded by Nigerianprince and [KILLAQUEEN123](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KILLAQUEEN123). The group is mainly focused on doing spawnbases and projects such as locating and griefing [Bedrockcity](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bedrockcity) in collaboration with [Franknificant](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Franknificant) and [Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys). Currently the group is mainly lead by Nigerian, [Nasder](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nasder) and [Poisonvenom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Poisonvenom) after [KILLAQUEEN123](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KILLAQUEEN123) became inactive.

### Astral brotherhood
Nigerianprince joined [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) in April 2023. Initially there he would be inactive there being busy with other projects and bases but in June he would start building more at their base [hallstat](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/hallstat) and start liking the group and becoming more active there. some time later he would be promoted to a meteorite within the group and he would go on and build at variety of bases with the group including [Fort concord](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fort_concord) and [Spawn migration 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_migration_2). He is currently celestium rank within the group.

Project ‘Obsidian Sky’ was the second project undertaken by the [Infinity Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinity_Incursion) in early 2020.

## History
The project was started on April 29th 2020. It focussed on the construction of a massive 2050 by 2050 block obsidian plateau over Spawn, engulfing spawn in darkness for new players. It worked on the foundations of an earlier project from 2017 with the same name. The project required almost 600,000 blocks of obsidian and was completed on May 31st 2020. It laid the foundation for [Linked Horizon Sky](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Linked_Horizon_Sky) and [Project Dead](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Project_Dead).

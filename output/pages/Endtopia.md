}}**Endtopia** was an end base founded by [Llane](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Llane) and [Offtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Offtopia) that housed [Krobar01's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Krobar01) Interdimensional Bridge.
## History
### Foundation and Construction
Endtopia was founded in late 2018 by [Llane](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Llane) and [Offtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Offtopia). After bringing materials there and building structures such as Offtopia's Hub, the base became very sparsely active. Many members stopped playing 2b2t altogether throughout 2019. This inactivity was initially heightened by the [Authentication exploit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc#Authentication_exploit), although it also resulted in [Endcursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Krobar01#Endcursion) being compromised. Because of this, [Krobar01](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Krobar01) no longer had a secure [End](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/End) base to build at. He subsequently accepted an invitation to build at Endtopia. Krobar01 constructed his Interdimensional Bridge alone at the base over the course of several months in mid 2020. Krobar01 built the bridge as a self-described "...island of colour in the void." After the initial period of construction, he shifted his focus to [Whitehaven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Whitehaven) for much of late 2020 and early 2021, returning to Endtopia to continue the basements in the bridge. The base laid relatively dormant for most of 2021.

### Grief
Endtopia was discovered by [Durkaaqt](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Durkaaqt) while basehunting. He was streaming in the [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association) discord server with the intention being to find a stash for the members of the group. Endtopia was compromised when [Im_Stexs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Im_Stexs) gave the location to [Moonshine](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Moonshine). Krobar01 griefed much of the base over the course of a two hour pvp match before being killed back to spawn by Im_Stexs. [PaulSteve007](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/PaulSteve007) completed the grief after it was found that Moonshine was repairing the base in order to make a griefing video.

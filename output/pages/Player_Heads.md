**Player heads** are items that were created by [Pyrobyte](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pyrobyte) and [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan) during their [backdoors](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/backdoor). They are currently considered illegal items, and will be deleted when interacted with by a player.

## History
Player heads were originally created by Pyrobyte and iTristan during their backdoors. Later heads were created by [The Tyranny](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc) in early 2016. Prior to 2016, player heads were considered rare items. In 2016, they were publicised, and heavily duped during the [11/11 Dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/11%2F11_Dupe). The heads of many players were produced by iTristan and Pyrobyte, however, only a handful of these ever reached the public. In 2016, numerous new player heads were created by The Tyranny, however, all of these have since been lost with the destruction of [The Archive](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Archive_(build)).

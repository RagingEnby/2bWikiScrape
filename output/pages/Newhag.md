**NewHag** is a PvPer who joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) in early 2021.

## History
### Imperials & Outlast
NewHag first joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) in March 2021. He did not start actively playing until around March 2022. Throughout 2022, he played on and off at solo bases. In early 2023, he joined [The Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Imperials) and began ranking up in the group over the next few weeks. After a short amount of time, he ranked up to Tribune and then to Legate in [The Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Imperials) while creating new bases such as Reclatorium II and participating in already made bases. He resigned from the imperials in late May of 2023. He left the group following the foundation of [Outlast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Outlast) in May 2023. He built at many of the group's bases, such as Spawnbase 1, Spawnbase 2, and Spawnbase 3.

## Emperium & The Teutonic Order
NewHag joined Teutonic Order in June 2023 to start pvping at nether spawn with them, leading to him refocusing his gameplay style to mainly constitute pvp. He actively pvped with the Teutonic Order from June to November 2023, before gradually transitioning to pvping with [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium) starting in September 2023 when he joined the group and occasionally based with them. He continued to be active in Emperium for an extended period afterwards.

## Newhag's Config Server
NewHag has had a hacked client configuration discord called NewHag's Config Server since May 2023, which distributes configuration for modules of commonly-used [Hacked Clients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hacked_Clients), amassing over 1000 members. At first it carried only PvP Configs for Future Client until early 2024, when he began uploading ElytraFly and travel configs, in the process becoming a hub of hacked client configs.

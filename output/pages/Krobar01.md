**Krobar01**, (often referred to as **Krobar**), is consistently recognized as one of 2b2t's best builders. He is known for his numerous, unique, and extensive projects, such as M.O.A.K. at [Numenor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Numenor), the Interdimensional Bridge at [Endtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Endtopia), his castle at [Whitehaven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Whitehaven), Phenomena at [Five Isles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Five_Isles), and the Ring at [Endhaven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Endhaven). He joined the server in 2017 and played consistently until going semi-inactive in early 2024.

## History
### Follytonvilleshire
Krobar01 joined 2b2t on January 20, 2017. He initially kept to himself, grinding gear and farming materials. After establishing himself properly, Krobar founded Follytonvilleshire. He started there by building a structure he called 'Krobar's Keep', which was a small-scale version of M.O.A.K. (Mother Of All Keeps). He also built his Mad Scientist Aquarium and Happy Ogre Sunken Pyramidal Arboretum and Bar, built in a drained out ocean monument. His builds gained the attention of players due to his posts on [r/2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/r%2F2b2t), causing him to be invited to [Wintermelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Wintermelon), though declined as he was in the middle of a build. After completing the base, he had Follytonvilleshire added to [The Museum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Museum), where it was made public and yet lasted ungriefed until [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) destroyed it during his [Month of Destruction](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Month_of_Destruction) a year later.

### Summermelon
:*See also: [Summermelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Summermelon)*
Krobar joined Wintermelon's builders at [Summermelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Summermelon) after they relocated there in April 2017. While there, Krobar built Meloncolony - a mountain fortress topped with a lizard scaling the walls, and a large wind-powered factory complete with driving belts, winches, and conveyors. The base was caught up in an ongoing conflict between [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) and [Offtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Offtopia) and so was griefed on July 28, 2017, by Fit, [AlphaComputer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlphaComputer), and several others.  As Krobar had recently joined the [Spawnmasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons) several months previous, this caused significant internal drama there, with AlphaComputer being kicked from the group for participating in the grief. Krobar also left the Spawnmasons (who, in turn, temporarily disbanded shortly thereafter), before later rejoining the reformed group and befriending [Ain360](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ain360) and [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids), who later invited Krobar to several of their various bases.

### Endcursion
Before Summermelon was griefed, Krobar01 was invited to [Space Jam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_Jam) by other members of the Spawnmsons. The base fell before Krobar01 could build a meaningful amount, so started a new base nearby, which he named Endcursion, where he built before returning to Summermelon. He returned there periodically for the next few years, constructing the iconic Cthulhu statue, the Isles, the Airship Armada, and Void Rider. Construction there was made difficult because the end was oftentimes inaccessible, in addition to rampant lag issues and disabled elytras. After finishing all the other various projects, Krobar cleared out an area that was originally intended for the Interdimensional Bridge, although he abandoned the base after it was compromised by [0x22](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0x22) with the [Authentication exploit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc#Authentication_exploit) in early 2020. The base lasted to September 2020 when it was griefed by [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) on Krobar's request after it was leaked by [Jakethesnake52](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jakethesnake52).

### Numenor
:*See also: [Numenor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Numenor)*

Following the grief of Summermelon, Krobar01 was invited to [Numenor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Numenor) by Offtopia, in August 2017. In Krobar01's words, "...[Offtopia] told me to build something big, so I built M.O.A.K." M.O.A.K. was a large circular sandstone build which featured many tendril-like towers, a central tower, and a whole city surrounding the hole the build was placed in. Krobar had originally designed and built M.O.A.K. as the centerpiece of his singleplayer world, before building a small-scale version at Follytonvilleshire. He spent several months constructing it on 2b2t until its grief as a result of a leak from the [BoeMeccan Witch Trials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BoeMeccan_Witch_Trials).

### Block Game Jerusalem
:*See also: [Block Game Jerusalem](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Jerusalem)*
Through the fallout of the BoeMeccan Witch Trials, both [Block Game Mecca](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Mecca) and Numenor had been griefed. Slappnbadkids, one of the founders of Block Game Mecca, invited him to the next [Block Game](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Gamers) base, [Block Game Jerusalem](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Jerusalem). He built intermittently there throughout 2018 and 2019, constructing his so-called 'Hovel', Skull, and Eye, although he was mostly on his own as the base was generally inactive following the world-edit deletion of the main stash. The Hovel was a large build made of obsidian, nether brick, and purple stained glass which was made to resemble a cathedral. The Skull was a large glass structure he named Ralph. The eye was a large eyeball falling from the sky with a partial optical nerve trailing behind it. He also helped in the initial design of the unfinished Temple at the base and later contributed materials for its construction. Also while basing there, he based with the group on [Constantiam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Constantiam), and met [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut).

### Mu
:*See also: [Mu](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mu)*
After the fall of Numenor, Krobar01 moved to Mu with the rest of its builders. There, he contributed a little on 2b2t itself, focusing on [bombing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bombers) out the massive central basin of the base to make way for the central terraform and the other basemates' various builds. In singleplayer however, he created the original design of what later became the Interdimensional Bridge after receiving inspiration from discussions about what to do at the base. He also designed a variety of other builds for the base that he later built in other locations after thematic changes at Mu prevented their construction at Mu, such as the Poseidon statue and Endcursion towers.

### Poseidon
After [duping](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Duplication_glitches) extensively at several locations, Krobar01 brought all of the items to a single spot which was originally intended to just be a stash. He began building there in September 2018 with a general oceanic theme because of the then-incoming update to 1.13 and its significant additions to oceans. He started with a broken ship, then put the base's namesake, Poseidon, in the middle. He continued with a large seahorse statue, the central aquarium. He later added the distinctive custom corals and sea grasses after seeing that the update to 1.13 wasn't coming soon and wanting more life underwater between the islands the rest of the builds there were situated on. [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) came to Poseidon as a result of [Nocom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nocom), but did not grief it. Krobar decided to abandon the base after the nether nearby showed significant increases in player activity. As part of the grief, the location was filled with Elder Guardians that had been stashed near the base.

### Endtopia
:*See also: [Endtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Endtopia)*

Following the Authentication Exploit, Krobar01 was invited to [Llane's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Llane) and Offtopia's end base, [Endtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Endtopia). He constructed his Interdimensional Bridge alone at the base over the course of several months in mid 2020. The Interdimensional Bridge was a large and distinctive bridge with portals on each side that had a canal running overtop, flanked by a town decorated for a festival. Krobar01 described the bridge as an "...island of colour in the void." After the initial period of construction he shifted his focus to Whitehaven for much of late 2020 and early 2021, returning to Endtopia to continue the basements in the bridge's legs. After Endtopia's discovery by [Durkaaqt](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Durkaaqt), who was streaming while basehunting in the [SBA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SBA) discord server, the location was compromised when [Im_Stexs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Im_Stexs) gave the location to [Moonshine](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Moonshine). Krobar01 griefed much of the base over the course of a two hour pvp match before being killed back to spawn by Im_Stexs. [PaulSteve007](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/PaulSteve007) completed the grief after it was found that Moonshine was repairing the base in order to make a griefing video.

### Whitehaven
:*See also: [Whitehaven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Whitehaven)*

In August 2020, Krobar01 was invited by jared2013 to his new base with [orsond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/orsond), then called 'Teton'. After selecting a palette and style with jared2013, he was left alone there a few weeks later when jared and orsond moved on and their other basemate [Yarnamite](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Yarnamite) went inactive. Krobar began construction of a large castle complex there in a distinctive palette of granite foundations, quartz walls, red nether brick roofs, and various similar blocks for texturing and depth. He also renamed Teton to Whitehaven and assumed ownership of the base. After building alone for several months and completing the central castle. Then, he invited several new base members - including his long-time friend, [Terbin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Terbin), and a more recent acquaintance, Joey_Coconut. This began a long-term friendship and creative partnership between the two where Krobar mentored Joey in building and Joey sought out other builders to invite to the rest of the bases Krobar built at for the rest of his time on the server. Krobar and Joey continued to build there mostly alone for several months until the base was compromised, bringing many of the base's other members back again to rush out sections of the base over early May 2021. Through this, Krobar focused on expanding the surrounding farmland and houses in order to help tie in far-flung sections of the base. He also helped to grief the base upon its leak.

### Five Isles
:*See also: [Five Isles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Five_Isles)*
Krobar01 founded Five Isles as a solo base on July 22, 2020 following various disruptions to his other projects throughout early 2020 (such as the griefs of Mu and Poseidon, and the compromisation of Endcursion). After positioning accounts there and starting to plan the base, he was invited to Whitehaven, causing Krobar put Five Isles on hold until Whitehaven's grief in June 2021. While he'd initially planned Five Isles to be a solo base with 5 different large-scale builds, following the griefs of Whitehaven and Block Game Jerusalem and having enjoyed building with them, he invited several of the base's members to Five Isles, and gave four of the islands to [DarkXl6](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DarkXl6), [_gigo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_gigo), Joey_Coconut, and Terbin & [Wailn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Wailn) (which was, in turn, later given to [smcz19](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/smcz19)). After re-evaluating his plans at the base for just one island instead of the full five, Krobar built Phenomena island over a year and a half period from June 2021 to December 2022. Phenomena consisted of a large terraform, stylized [Sky roofs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sky_roof), and many dozens of custom trees, houses. As they had been building there largely by themselves, Krobar started a collaboration with Joey_Coconut where they built an airship battle. They also began a longterm process of connecting their areas via builds in order to tie the base together and to begin to fill out empty areas. After completing the coral around his island, Krobar shifted his focus to Endhaven temporarily, during which time Five Isles was found and Krobar's stash there was stolen by [6wj](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/6wj) and [KeyBison](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KeyBison). After discussing and agreeing that the base had run its course, Krobar and Joey_Coconut self-griefed the base on December 16, 2022.

### Endhaven
:*See also: [Endhaven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Endhaven)*
After the grief of [Endtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Endtopia) and a near discovery of [Five Isles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Five_Isles) in early 2022, Krobar01, along with Joey_Coconut and [Terbin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Terbin), began planning a new End base in order to have a safe location to build at. While Joey led the travel effort, often [BoatTPing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BoatTP) Krobar to end gateways along the route in case of a death, the two coordinated closely over three months in early 2022 to travel deep into the end. Once Joey tired of traveling and picked a spot, they settled there and named the base Endhaven, as to continue the naming convention of Krobar’s previous End projects. To disguise the route taken, the two first set up a decoy base at the end of the trail called Endtropilis Gigabase. As with their previous collaborations, Krobar funded the base while Joey handled the base roster, bringing in most of the members from the leadership of the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood). After setting up basic infrastructure there and bringing accounts out, the base sat dormant for most of 2022 as Krobar returned his focus to Five Isles. He spent late 2022 designing the Ring - a city made of oddly-angled builds placed on large dyson sphere, surrounding a black hole with quasars shooting out of its ends. After completing the design, he brought a large stash to Endhaven, cleared a large area of void, and built the Ring within it. His completion of the Ring nearly coincided with Five Isles' self-grief late in the year. After completing the Ring, Krobar moved back to the Block Game base on Constantiam before going semi-inactive in 2024, leaving Joey to run Endhaven and giving him several of his stashes. Krobar has logged on periodically following Endhaven's self-grief to farm new materials and adjust to the new update.

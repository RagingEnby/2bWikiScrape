**Point Nemo** is a base located on the 2b2t +X Overworld World Border, constructed by the [+X Digging Group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/%2BX_Digging_Group). The base was griefed only a week after construction began, and was completely wiped out in the following months.

## History
The landscape of the area was generated in 1.6. The first known people who reached the area were [Pyrobyte](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pyrobyte) and [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan) on December 7th, 2013 (most likely with a backdoor). They left a bedrock platform on the other side of the border with two signs, reading:

*It's the end*

*of the world!*

*-Pyrobyte*

*Dec. 7 2013*

*iTristan was*

*here. If you*

*see this, shit*

*went down.*

iTristan also left a book from the Mein Kampf collection, created by Victormeriqui, and a pair of 32k leggings on the other side of the border.

* December 9, 2016: [Byrnsy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Byrnsy) started a journey towards the very same place, thus forming the [+X Digging Group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/%2BX_Digging_Group). It was established that once they reach the World Border, they were going to build a base there, just like they did at other notable points. They named it Point Nemo, after the [oceanic pole of inaccessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pole_of_inaccessibility) - the furthest point on Earth from land, located in the Southern Pacific Ocean.
* March 26, 2017: the first group of diggers - [househousehouse1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/househousehouse1), [xxq](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xxq), [irql](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/irql), [rasqi](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/rasqi), [miningminecraft](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/miningminecraft), and several others - reached the World Border, and discovered Pyro's and iTristan's signs. They also managed to retrieve the Mein Kampf book. As other group members also arrived, construction on the base began.
* March 28, 2017: when Byrnsy finished his journey, the place had already started to take shape. However, a day later, it was griefed.
* April 24, 2017: [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) finished his own journey to the world border, and several of the former diggers, including Byrnsy, gathered at the partially repaired base as a formal welcome party.
* April 30, 2017: the base was griefed again.
* During May 2017, the base was fully destroyed and lavacasted beyond repair.

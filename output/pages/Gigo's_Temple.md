}}[_gigo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_gigo)'s Temple, also known as **The Japanese Temple**, was a massive build created by [_gigo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_gigo) in mid 2019. It was demolished later that year by [Finstaa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Finstaa) and some others after it was suspected that [Babbaj](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Babbaj) had leaked the coordinates.

## History
### Founding
[_gigo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_gigo) had left his first base, Alpha Site, and went to stake out a new location for a base. He now had access to the chunk dupe, and was able to acquire a large amount of wealth to start his new project. He designed some of the temple in creative first, then built it himself on the server.

### Leak and Grief
One day [_gigo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_gigo) recieved a message from [Babbaj](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Babbaj)'s alt, NormieSlayer, saying that he was going to nuke his temple. It is thought that [Babbaj](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Babbaj) leaked coordinates thereafter, since some time later Finstaa got the coords and decided to grief it along with some friends as an event. The temple was almost complete when it was griefed, a few wall panels are still missing in its final state.

**Zispanos** is a group mainly formed of spanish speaking players that quickly gained a lot of popularity among the 2b2t community, being founded in January 2020, at the same time being the first group to be formed the same year. It quickly gained thousands of members on their discord and tens of members in the group itself, it has also been mainly advertised trough youtube videos of various big youtubers and gained a big chunk of relevance because of the videos of the group's members (mainly consisted of crystal pvp montages). The group has been founded by Zedu and has a strict filter of members, having thousands of applications and only accepting a small portion of them.

## History
Zedu started playing 2b2t on 2018, but he never was involved in the english nor spanish community of 2b2t. In 2020 he asked some newbie thing in spanish and Jorge2106 (current Veteran) replied to him and they began talking and as the conversation progressed those who would become future veterans joined the conversation (SmashIV_Z, SrViper, Gusheis). This group of 5 players that didn't know about the 2b2t community decided to make a team for spanish players, Zedu thought that there were no Spanish teams at that time so he decided to create his own, they created the discord server on 3rd January 2020, they spammed the clan in order to make spanish players join them and play together.
At the very beginning, you just needed to speak fluently spanish to join them. But as Zispanos started growing they started select members more carefully and create more roles (Zispanos Miembro and Zispanos Veterano were created during that time, and a few weeks later Zispanos Novato was created too). Zispanos first allied with the 2 biggest spanish clan on 2b2t, Legion G4MEMODE and Hermandad Hispana (Both disbanded nowadays), Then Imperial Empire offered an allyship with Zispanos that lasted a month, when Zispanos broke the allyship peacefully. Some time later, Zedu started contacting with some High Ranks of Emperium and that made posible to make a allyship between Zispanos and The Emperium.

### End Dupe
On February 22, 2020, a leader of Hermandad Hispana, Young, told to Zedu about a working dupe that required to have the total control of the end spawn, the first day was a constant PvP between Zispanos and Emperium against other groups that were trying to stole the spawn control.

More than 10 members of Zispanos were defending the end collaborating with Emperium and there were long battles, were it was impossible to dupe.

During this dupe method, Zispanos started growing of popularity among the 2b2t non-spanish community

### "La Ciudad"
Before this moment, each rank had their own bases, and Zedu thought about doing Group bases that joined in one place most of the ranks of Zispanos. One base standed above the others, "La Ciudad" was a huge building project where more than 15 members of Zispanos worked in order to make it the most outstanding base in Zispanos.

This base is widely known on the hispanic community as the most iconic base of Zispanos.

In April, three famous spanish youtubers did a video about that base.

He has also been building with the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) and [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association).

## History
**xrayessay** started off on 2b2t in 2019, and quickly escaped spawn. He spent his first days roaming spawn and getting geared. One of his first memories is the [Southern Canal](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Southern_Canal), which he used to escape initially. He quickly got established in the millions, and started building his first base after he found a stash his 3rd day on the server. He spent most of his time alone, building, until he met [Harrissssonn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Harrissssonn) in the summer of 2021. They became best friends and established a base together.

### Spawn Builders Association & The Ancients
[Harrissssonn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Harrissssonn) invited xrayessay to [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association), where he spent his time building at spawn bases with the group. After a while, he was invited to build at the event [Squid Games 3](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Squid_Games_3), where he met the other founders of the [Ancients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ancients), [YoMoBoYo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YoMoBoYo), [Minecraft_simon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Minecraft_simon) and [Hovecs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hovecs). Together, they formed the group [The Ancients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Ancients). During the Squid Games event, he began experimenting with 3d models, something he found himself enjoying.

After Squid Games 3 event was over, the [Ancients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ancients) began building at different bases, and collaborating with other groups such as the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) and The [Spawnmasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons). Here, he joined the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) and became a guest within the [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons). During this time, he worked on cool projects with the [Ancients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ancients), such as [Our/place](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Our%2Fplace).

### SpawnMasons & Astral Brotherhood
Astral Brotherhood was the perfect place for xrayessay to meet more amazing builders and build together with. Here he met close friends such as [Cpybara](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cpybara) and [Joey Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut). He built a massive cathedral at [Dubrovnik](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dubrovnik), which became one of the finest builds at the base. Multiple bases were built together with Astral, and he contributed in building contest within the group. After the base fell in early 2023, he released a tribute video to the base, using his 3d animation skills. After he was invited as guest to the SpawnMasons, he got invited to build at their main base, [Sky Masons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sky_Masons). Together with YoMoBoYo, they constructed 'The Lighthouse and The Blimp'. The Blimp was a creative project for the last 5 years for xrayessay, and Sky was a big motivation to finish the build. With the help of [YoMoBoYo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YoMoBoYo), it felt like an honor to have it built at Sky. While at the base, he decided to test his skills with animation, so as a surprise for the Masons, he started a secret project to make an animation of the base. He spent 6 months animating, and before he could finish, the base would be griefed. The video released a few days after the Skyfall, and ended up as a tribute for the base. After this, he got invited to become a Mason, and was initiated the 26th November 2022.

### Today
Today, he is still building together with his groups, and has contributed in events such as the [SpawnQuarium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnQuarium) and [Spawn Migration](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Migration).

**Exodus** was a small base founded by [CainesLaw](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CainesLaw) and [Tachrev](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tachrev) in early 2015.

## History
Following the destruction of their previous base, [CainesLaw](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CainesLaw) and [Tachrev](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tachrev) were invited to a group base by the griefer, LazyNickers. After building for a bit, they decided to move and found a nice peninsula nearby, where they founded Exodus. The base originally had a large cobblestone wall, a house built by [Tachrev](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tachrev), and a small gold farm built by [CainesLaw](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CainesLaw).

[CainesLaw](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CainesLaw) later did some exploring and found a dupe stash, which he robbed and used to improve the gold farm at Exodus. Both of the builders continued to play at the base for a little while until it was griefed in March of 2015. On May 31st, 2015, the two founded Aureus City.

[The Boedecken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Boedecken) was founded close to the location of Exodus and was surprisingly not found due to its location but rather destroyed due to an inside job.

[CainesLaw](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CainesLaw) rebuilt the base sometime in 2019 but he decided not to expand it further. Surprisingly the rebuilt base lasted for over 3 years until it was griefed by [Dima788](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dima788) on January 28th 2023.

}}The **SpawnQuarium** was a community event hosted by The [Ancients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ancients) through the [Spawn Migrators](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Migrators). The event was held in the Spawn [Watercube](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn#Watercubing) with an "Aquarium" theme. The event lasted for almost a month, with many players contributing to the event, and many different groups such as [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood), [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons), [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association), [Bookhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bookhood), and [The Last Templar](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Last_Templar) also taking part.
## History
### Foundation
The idea behind SpawnQuarium first came up after [YoMoBoYo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YoMoBoYo) helped construct a large anglerfish inside the [Watercube](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn#Watercubing) at [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn) in 2022. He had a vision of the watercube being filled with lots of different builds, ranging from different types of fish to underwater ships. After consulting with his group, the [Ancients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ancients), they decided to do an entire underwater aquarium base. With the help of [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) and the [Spawn Migrators](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Migrators), they brought together a ton of builders from all different groups, and started slowly announcing the idea and the plan.

### Construction
Building started 10th of March, centered around the obsidian anglerfish several of the Ancients had constructed the previous year. The base progressed quickly, with over 50 fish and underwater structures being built in the first 4 days alone. [RulesOff](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/RulesOff) created a website which contained a webmap of the water cube, and all the builds that built throughout the project, which he periodically updated until the end of construction at the location. . The building materials for the event were laregely funded by the Ancients, specifically [RulesOff](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/RulesOff) and [_chiekn_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_chiekn_).

The event concluded with a spleef event hosted by [xrayessay](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xrayessay) and YoMoBoYo. After two weeks of building, over 100 builds were constructed by 42 different builders. A final video showcasing all the builds was also released at that time. Even though the event ended, builders continued to build fish in the area in the following days.

### Grief
Owing to the base's placement underwater, with all builds also being filled with water, it was not griefed by any players and continues to stand well after the event almost untouched beyond minimal wither damage.

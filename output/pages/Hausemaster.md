**Hausemaster**, commonly called **Hause**, and formerly known as **Housemaster** or **House**, is the name given to the owner of 2b2t. It is important to note that the player 'Hausemaster' and the server ownership (also often referred to as 'Hausemaster') are likely not the same person anymore. Hausemaster was originally the username used by 2b2t's founder on many websites as early as 2008, and after co-founding the 2b2t *Minecraft* server with [georgebush420](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/georgebush420) in 2010, he gradually became more referred to as "Hausemaster", as that was the spelling of his *Minecraft* username. Today, the name continues to refer to the administrator of 2b2t and its official entities, despite there being a reported change of ownership.

On July 31, 2014, a [message](https://web.archive.org/web/20140820055953/http://2b2t.org/) appeared on the now-defunct 2b2t website saying that the Hause had left 2b2t forever and was no longer an owner, leaving the server to be operated by "an anonymous friend." Almost immediately following this post, the owner's personality changed. Because of this, combined with the person's frequent lack of communication and interaction with the community, it is often believed that someone other than the original Hausemaster owns 2b2t, most likely [georgebush420](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Georgebush420). There are claims that the message was a hoax, although they are likely dubious at best.

Hausemaster's Minecraft account has not been called Hausemaster since 2015, with it changing names to **HOUSE_MASTER** in March 2015 and again to **expunged** in May 2015, which was the last name before the account was deleted in April 2021. The account with the name Hausemaster was owned by 2b2t and [Constantiam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Constantiam) old player Jukepolice.

## History
### Early history
*See also: [Timeline ยง Pre-2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Timeline#Pre-2b2t), [2b2t ยง Origin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t#Origin), [2fort2furious](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2fort2furious), and [2b2t (*Garry's Mod* server)](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_(Garry%27s_Mod_server))*

In 2008, Hause became active on the *Team Fortress 2* server 2fort2furious (2f2f). On February 20, 2008, he created his account on the server's forum; a [archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20080226145558/https://forums.2fort2furious.com/userlist.php) of the forum from February 26 is credited as the earliest known recorded mention of him going under the name "Housemaster". The name likely originated as a play on the name Floormaster, the owner of 2fort2furious.

On August 29, 2008, Hause began the 2b2t Steam group to host game servers, titled "2builders2tools (2b2t)". The name was a parody of the 2f2f server he was in. After Kalash was banned from 2f2f for exploits, Hause created [2b2t's *Garry's Mod* server](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_(Garry%27s_Mod_server)) in 2008, which lasted until 2009. Several other servers were hosted by the 2b2t Steam group.

In early 2009, Hause mostly played *Half-Life 2*, *Garry's Mod*, and *Team Fortress 2*.

### 2b2t involvement
Hause and George created 2b2t in late December 2010, becoming the de-facto owner shortly after due to George's poor Internet connection. Hause occasionally joined 2b2t from its creation until around 2015, and he also sometimes teleported to various online players around the server. Several of his appearances were made using the account server_operator.  Hause said in an email at no point did they actively play nor follow what happened on the server; making updates and fixes was Hause's main interaction with the community.

### Patches and Game Breaking Rules
The only "rule" that Hause has added to the server is that it is illegal to use game-breaking tools that make the game unfair. He has added plugins to cause people using insane speed hacks and fly hacks to be kicked from the server. He has also patched several Dupe glitches, Backdoors, and other hack based glitches (i.e., Bed TP). Hause has been known to have used MC Edit to get rid of ridiculous lag machines and illegally placed bedrock, and once removed a giant wall around spawn (which ironically happened not long before rusher joined). Despite all this, he does let players keep duplicated items and usually takes his sweet long time patching things, causing players to be able to squeeze as much as they can out of glitches.

Hause has currently patched only one thing related to Vanilla Minecraft that does not involve hacking or glitches. This patch was for frost walker, an enchantment added in Minecraft 1.10, which several players used to freeze up entire rivers, builds with water, and even oceans.

Another object that has received plenty of attention is the elytra due to players finding glitches and hacks to cause infinite flight. Eventually, Hausemaster patched the first elytra glitch during the summer of 2016 (when elytras were first added) and the second during the time of the 5th Incursion. The third glitch, which used an exploit in the options provided in the hacked client known as Aristois, was patched on January 23rd, 2017, by Hausemaster as he now officially "banned" the elytras usage making it the second vanilla item removed from 2b2t. However, in 2019 it was once again enabled, with a cap on maximum flight speed when using hacked elytra flight.

He also disabled /kill for a time, to prevent the "apocalypse exploit" from being used (whereby a player would kill themselves while passing into the overworld through a nether portal, causing the game to think the player was both at their spawn point and the overworld side of the portal, forcing the game to load all the chunks between those two locations), but later re-enabled it after patching the exploit.

Starting in November, 2019, when the [Brownmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Brownmen) began "No Server November", Hause implemented a new form of 'punishment', called a priority ban, or prioban for short. This new policy was made so that any player appearing to be lagging the server would be kicked and stripped of their priority queue. In addition, in 2021, Hause also implemented a 'mute' punishment, which would 'ban' a player from using public chat, or even private chat. All of this would add up and cause major controversy in early 2022, when over the priority ban list exceeded 400 accounts, many banned for seemingly no reason.

This is put into more detail in [Punishments](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Punishments).

### Backdoor management
The server has currently been backdoored four times and the subreddit one time. The first two backdoors were caused by [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob) during the early [Facepunch](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Facepunch_Republic) era. The second backdoor was caused by [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan) and [Pyrobyte](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pyrobyte) to allow for them to reach the world border and create more hacked items, and the third by [the Tyranny](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc), which allowed for insane destruction.

The third backdoor caused the creation of [super weapons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/32K_Weapons) with insane enchantments like level 32K sharpness swords, knockback swords that could kick a person for flying and looting swords that could crash the server by making mobs drop thousands of items at once. The group also used the account to create player heads of various players. This was the event that has caused the existence of 32k items to exist on the server up to today, and now they are almost commonplace in the ever-inflating server economy.

The fourth backdoor was the most damaging to date. The Tyranny managed to get in contact with the admin [georgebush420](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/georgebush420) who colluded with them.

Hause stopped popbob's [Thunder Hack](https://github.com/Pan4ur/ThunderHack-Recode) by disabling thunder on 2b2t. The addition of illegal items was almost impossible to fix, considering that many players got their hands on them and began duping them. As more and more players began using these items, Hause attempted to fix the problem by manually deleting various groups of items, and partially succeeded, but not without accidentally deleting Sharpness axes in the process. Furthermore, not all illegals were deleted, which allowed for more duping (of course) and they remain a hallmark of the current 2b2t atmosphere even today. However, now there is a plugin to automatically revert these items to normal when their containers are loaded in.

### Queue and Rusher fiasco
The current [Queue](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Queue) system that has been implemented into 2b2t is the revamped queue suggested by [Rusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher). Hause created the original queue to try to control the flooding from Rusher's video, however, it was not the greatest queue system. This caused a lot of people to be angry (especially oldfags), which Rusher noticed. Rusher suggested to Hause that he could buy the server to make it lag-free, but Hause declined the offer because 2b2t would arguably be much worse and wouldn't have it's original 'feels'. Rusher then suggested the current queue, which added the Veteran Queue system and Priority Queue. Veteran Queue gave the oldfags who joined before June 1, 2016, a smaller wait time depending on how long ago they joined. The Priority Queue offers a smaller wait time than even the Veteran Queue, but costs $20 a month. Hause liked the idea and so allowed Rusher and his crew to add and control the queue, which spawned a little hate. This, however, was abused by Rusher, such as when he removed [Torogadude](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Torogadude) from the veteran queue for bed-trapping [LandonMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/LandonMC) after toro logged into his Minecraft account, causing a Rusher response video ultimately when controversy ensued. Torogadude eventually got his queue priority back (at least until the veteran queue was removed for everyone), and no one else had their privileges illegitimately revoked. Hausemaster later made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/4yq20l/2b2t_drama_there_is_none_its_just_a_block_game/) about the fiasco, saying that Minecraft is just a block game.

### Spawn
Hausemaster has flattened spawn in the past, which can be seen in some of [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2)'s world downloads. This meant he removed tall structures like lava-pillars and [lavacasts](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lavacast) to make escaping spawn easier. He also expanded the default spawn radius several times as the community worked harder and harder to enclose and control the spawn area during influxes of new players. According to [THEJudgeHolden](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/THEJudgeHolden), Hause built a few fields with animals in the nether when food was introduced.

### Username origin
The name "Hausemaster" is of unknown origin. The name could be from his 2f2f days, in 2008, as one of the administrators on the now-gone 2f2f forums was named FLOOR_MASTER. Hause's name on *Team Fortress 2* and the Facepunch forums was HOUSEMASTER. The "Hause" spelling could be from the "HOUSEMASTER" account already being bought on *Minecraft*.

Another theory regarding his username is that it comes from [Arfenhouse: The Movie](https://www.newgrounds.com/collection/arfenhouse) which was first released April 21, 2002. This is the story about the Arfenhouse, a large, faceless mansion in the middle of nowhere, owned by Housemaster, a strange bread-like hero person.

### Post-Rusher War
After the war, Hause would do a few more things such as re-enabling elytras, then disabling them again later, (no) thanks to Fit. He also updated 2b2t to 1.11, which patched the 11/11 dupe. He also patched the Donkey dupe and llama dupe.

### AAC Test
On April 25, 2017, Hausemaster attempted to enable elytras while using AAC as the server's new [anticheat](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Anti_Cheat). On that day, over 90 people were kicked, even players that weren't using hacked clients. On the same day, over 100 emails were sent to Hausemaster telling him to remove AAC as there were too many false kicks, but none received a response. The change was later reverted.

### AAC re-added
After a short time, Hause re-added AAC in early May with a much better update 3.1.6 which reduced the number of disconnects and issues being reported on the server. The changed cause [hacked clients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hacked_Clients) to still be "buggy as hell", however it was overall better tolerated.

### 1.12 server improvements
The administration spent much of the servers life on 1.12 working and revamping aspects of the server to increase quality of life. This reddit post listed the planned changes and improvements until it was deleted:

https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/6h092r/2b2t_112_update_a_reminder_that_you_are_here/

## Bases
According to [Fit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTZLWHtip24), Hausemaster having his base was a commonly repeated meme. On August 8th, 2016, a rusher named GrayGraySage posted a Reddit post on that his friend had found a base named Hitlerville. Gray came to the base and that he spotted three members at the base: georgebush420, "[Noodle](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Noodle)", and "[Baj](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Baj)". After he logged off and came back on the next day, the entire base had been removed, and chunks reverted. Many didn't trust gray about this. However, in November of 2019, [ChromeCrusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ChromeCrusher) found out that the base had been moved by using WorldEdit, and promptly [blew it up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUcMEE3OCy4) with [AlphaComputer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlphaComputer). [SalC1 recorded a video pre-grief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFTO-2_pC5s), and noted how the bedrock patterns at the base's location is the same as under the one found by Gray's friend. The base was a mess, with crudely made swastikas thrown about, and a bizarre central fort made of gold, redstone, and other materials.
[BarrenDome](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BarrenDome) has also found a [supposed base](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-ZSnVnqpVw) by Hausemaster. It isn't as massive as Hitlerville and only seemed to have one other member, "Nick". The only evidence for it being made by Hause is that there are books signed by Hausemaster (No screenshots though, so they might be a lie) and how weirdly the base was griefed. The grief showed signs of a world-edit.

## Drama
Hause has been criticized for directly interfering with the 2b2t world using MCEdit and [WorldEdit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/WorldEdit) by adding / [removing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/removing) things such as massive lag machines. Hause has also been praised / criticized for adding End Portals to the world. The community of 2b2t likes to joke that Hause doesn't do anything with 2b2t unless he is high on cocaine. Hause has also been notorious for not being involved with the server for long periods, letting players do what they wanted (which to some oldfags was a good thing) as well as giving Rusher control of the priority queue system. His game-breaking rules are criticized since the server is an anarchy server where anything should be possible but has received praise as these glitches and hacks would make the server pointless and not very fun.

## List of Admins
While it is generally recognized that Hause is the sole admin (at least meant to be) on 2b2t, it has been speculated and theorized that there are/were others. This is a list of all confirmed and possible Administrators of 2b2t.
* Hausemaster - The original owner. He also ran the official 2b2t website, as well as a Garry's Mod server which was less popular. The website indicates that Hause was growing tired of managing the server in 2013 until eventually he stopped altogether and handed 2b2t off to somebody else.
*"2builders2tools" / "2b2t" - The most probable current owner of the server, taking the reins from Hausemaster in July 2014. This is based on a message appearing on the server website in July 2014 stating that Hause had stopped running 2b2t and left the server to "an anonymous friend." The owner's personality changed after this message, and it is a personality still seen today. Hardly anything is known about him.
*server_operator - An account that would teleport to bases in the 2014-2015 era. In one instance this was done to assess the lag potential of the first few guardian farms on the server and their item collection and sorting methods.
*[georgebush420](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/georgebush420) - Suspected to be an actual person rather than just Hause's alt account (and vice versa).
*[iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan) - Due to suspicions of possible collusion between him and Hause during the 3rd backdoor.
* Other [Tyranny](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc) Members - It is also possible that Hause gave admin access to other members of the Tyranny, however very unlikely.
* [Curtis](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Curtis) - A close friend of [TheCampingRusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) who runs the [queue](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/queue) system due to an agreement between Hause and Rusher that the queue would be [Archon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Archon) run during the Rusher War. Curtis has never made claim to being the operator of 2b2t however player suspicions have grown as a result of many occurrences. These suspicions range from administrating the [subreddit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/subreddit) to even as far as operations of the entire server. Through the results of various players it has been discovered that Curtis has some affiliation and control of the 2b2t website at the very least. He is no longer an admin on the subreddit.
*Benjojo - Wrote a lot of the plugins for 2b2t back in 2012, and had an IP through his site to join the server if the 2b2t.net/.org domain didn't work. He quit 2b2t after believing it was filled with actual Neo-Nazis. On January 25, 2020, he was interviewed by [fastvincent1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fastvincent1) in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rilmPnFdUts).  His username was censored, but a 2b2t wiki admin did some research through the 4chan archives and [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/etw1tm/qna_with_benjojo_an_old_2b2t_staff_member/), and his username was also posted in the comment section by [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa).

## Trivia
* There is another account that now owns the name "Hausemaster" unrelated to the original Hausemaster.
*[Tyrone is popbob 2b2t.org](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlSok_3Ym3w) is the earliest mention of Hause on YouTube.

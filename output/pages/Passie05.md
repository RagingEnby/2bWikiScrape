**passie05**, colloquially known as **passie**, was an [oldfag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/oldfag) that joined in early-2011 from a 4chan post. He became a member of the [Facepunch Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Facepunch_Republic) before moving onto many more notable acts, including building the [Bedrock Comet](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bedrock_Comet) at [ZiggyBase](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ZiggyBase).

## History
]]

passie joined from a 4chan post in early-2011. He later based and helped create many notable landmarks such as [Passietown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Passietown) and [ZiggyBase](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ZiggyBase).

When Passie joined the server, there were players trying to recruit at spawn, after running around spawn, he got into contact with [pYr01v1aniac](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/pYr01v1aniac), and joined his underwater base. Unfortunately, that base would only last a few days. After this, Passie played alone for some time, creating small bases near spawn. while playing, Passie met players like [Policemike55](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Policemike55), [iClover](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iClover) and [Squidgeymon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Squidgeymon).

After his spawnbase base was griefed he decided to meet up and create a base with some of the players he had met.

They went out about 50k blocks and created an underground base colloquially called [The Squid Police](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Squid_Police), after a few weeks it was griefed and most of the base members left, except Passie05 and [policemike55](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/policemike55). Together they ended up traveling a lot further to 300k and created [Passietown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Passietown). Since [policemike55](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/policemike55) was inactive during the start of the base, it was very lonely, so Passie got into contact with [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2) and invited him to the base. Later more people joined like [Popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Popbob), [CreamOFtheSlop](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CreamOFtheSlop) and [Polly_the_Parrot](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Polly_the_Parrot) ,and contributed to the base.
Shortly after it was griefed by [Luke2thebun](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Luke2thebun), [Passie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Passie), [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2), [policemike55](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/policemike55), [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob) and [CreamOFtheSlop](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CreamOFtheSlop) set out to create a new base. Shortly after creating the new base, [Popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Popbob) gained backdoor access and the base was turned into [Plugin Town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Plugin_Town). also during this time, Passie and [Xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Xcc2) tried to restore spawn by removing lava casts and planting trees.

Not to long after, Passie and [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2) got into contact with [Ziggy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ziggy) and decided to create a spawn base. they traveled to -400, 800 nether and found a small abandoned base. Which they expanded further into [ZiggyBase](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ZiggyBase).
After a lot of drama surrounding [ZiggyBase](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ZiggyBase) occurred, and its griefing, Passie stopped playing for a while and took a break. A few months later, when he returned, Passie joined the [Jungle Saucer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jungle_Saucer) base that [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2) and some other builders created. Instead of building there, he decided to create a solo base nearby which started as an underwater base but later became [Passies 4 Castles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Passies_4_Castles). The last castle - that being the castle made of yellow wool and wood - of the 4 Castles was finished on October 1, 2014. In June 2012, he built the famous Bedrock Comet at ZiggyBase with the help of [ImperatorTerrae](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ImperatorTerrae), which would last until August 2020.

Today, Passie still plays 2b2t occasionally with their longtime friend [Xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Xcc2).

**P529** is a long-time player who joined after the Rusher invasion, and has built with multiple groups such as the [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons) and [Ancients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ancients). He is also known for being one of the founders of [The 4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_4th_Reich).

## History
P529 joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) about a month after the [Rusher Invasion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rusher_Invasion) started, and quickly became established on the server. After a few days, he met [Tim_McNukepants](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tim_McNukepants) and [Anar_NL](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Anar_NL). Together, they founded the [The 4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_4th_Reich) and started off by founding the [4th Reich Founding Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4th_Reich_Founding_Base). [The 4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_4th_Reich) proclaimed themselves sworn enemies of [The Vortex Coalition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Vortex_Coalition), griefing and PvPing affiliated bases and members on sight. The group served to introduce many old and new players, and also helped in the creation of such groups as [Spawnmasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons), [Valinor (Group)](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valinor_(Group)), and [Block Gamers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Gamers). The 4th Reich lasted until March 2017, when many members of the group moved to the [Spawnmasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons).

### SpawnMasons & Ancients
P529 joined the Spawnmasons during the first degree in March 2017. After joining the [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons), he spent most of his time there building, duping and using exploits. P529 often went to [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn) to distribute both uncommon and rare items, enabling average players to have [Illegal items](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Illegal_items). Many are still in circulation today, including P5's fully enchanted and stacked chainmail armor.

Together with the Spawnmasons, he would go on to build at notable bases, including [Smibville](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Smibville), [Vulcavito](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vulcavito) and [Autistralia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Autistralia). During Smibville, P529 began an extended break from [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t), and did not return until early 2022.

P529 returned to 2b2t in early 2022 as a result of [iTavux's Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTavux%27s_Republic), which started as an '11th Incursion' in response to the twitch streamer [Ninja](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YouTube_tourists#Ninja) joining the server. While the group was shortlived, it caused many inactive players to be temporarily reintroduced into the community; P529 stayed.

Upon his return in 2022, P529 became much more active on the server, and resumed playing with the Spawnmasons, building at their main base [Sky Masons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sky_Masons). He also assisted with the [Squid Games 3](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Squid_Games_3) event, which lead to him getting to know the newly started group the [Ancients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ancients). He quickly befriended all the members, and helped with other projects such as [Our/Place](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Our%2FPlace). He also built with them and others at the [Corner Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Corner_Base). He was later initiated into the group as a full member, and is currently still active with both the [Ancients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ancients) and the [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons).

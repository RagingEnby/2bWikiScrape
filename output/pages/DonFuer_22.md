}}**DonFuer 22** was a base built by [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) from September 15th 2021 until its destruction on December 17th 2021. It featured multiple medieval districts, a castle, an Asian-themed district, and a desert-themed district.
## Histroy
DonFuer 22 was founded by [D_loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_loaded) on September 15th 2021, shortly after the removal of multiple members for doxxing. After this unfortunate event, [iAmZeiss](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iAmZeiss) invited [Steampunkjax](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Steampunkjax) and [Jackpadge](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jackpadge) to help with DonFuer 22. The base expanded quickly, and by week 2 the main town was almost complete. By week 3 the castle was started, and by week 5 a second town and the Asian district were started. Around this time, [KingDeDeDONG](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KingDeDeDONG) discovered the base by accident while base hunting. He joined DonFuer soon thereafter and become an active participant at the base.

The base lasted until December 17, when it was griefed by [YouFoundSand](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YouFoundSand), [1Skew](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/1Skew), [3vt](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/3vt) and [Spartan4200](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spartan4200).

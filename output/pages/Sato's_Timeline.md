{{Sato}}**Sato's Timeline** was a series of [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) timelines created by [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86), which is generally accepted by the 2b2t community. It was updated every year or so until 2020 before being discontinued following Sato quitting the server. It includes an "Age" followed by a shorter "Period." The following was the last timeline in written form:
## Age of Unrest
. The notable banners include the 4channers and Facepunchers.]]
The Age of Unrest was a period of time between Beta 1.2 and Beta 1.8 where 2b2t had between 50-80 rising players. The main sources of players were ads run on 4chan which sparked the [4channers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4channers) or the collected [Facepunchers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Facepunchers).

## The Great Server Decay
.]]
**The Great Server Decay**, or simply **Great Decay**, was a time in [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t)'s history where the player-base stagnated in numbers. It lasted from 2012 to 2013, and during it the average amount of players online was about 40. The period was mostly fueled by 2b2t's domain change from 2b2t.net to 2b2t.org, coupled along with 3 months of down time during the change. This made many players believe that 2b2t was gone for good. This period is also considered one of the most widely-agreed periods on the 2b2t timeline, as many iterations of 2b2t timelines use it and due to its objectiveness. It is often represented with a skull and was thought to have no major active groups during its inception.

During the decay, overall activity was low and not as many bases where being built and griefed as in the 2011 days. [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) did a lot to try to save the server, such as hiring helpers for the server and setting up temp maps to experiment with plugins on.

### Context
Before the Great Decay, the server was experiencing a busy time in its history with lots of new bases being created and griefed, and many players joining and having conflicts with each other. This period is called the "Age of Unrest" in [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86)'s timeline. All of this activity strained the server, and 2b2t had to get better hardware to run. That coupled with player disinterest and some unknown factors, made Hausemaster and [Georgebush420](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Georgebush420) shut down the server for 3 months.

### End
The end of the Great Decay is not fully agreed upon. Sato86 himself has put the end at April 29th, 2013, the founding date of [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria). However, this could be a biased view of it, as Sato86 is one of Valkyria's founders. If Valkyria is not counted, its end could be put around mid-2013. Many new players began joining and stayed active, many of them from a Reddit post.

### Semi-Notable Events
*The [Old Spawn Road](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Old_Spawn_Road) (originally named the West Road) is founded by [LegitYarik](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/LegitYarik), along with the early construction of [The West Road Inn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Castle_Hatehart). It was, for a period of time, one of, if not the, longest Non-Axis roads.
*[2k2k](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2k2k), the last Facepunch Republic base, is founded as a refuge for remaining republic members and later buried in a [lavacast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/lavacast).

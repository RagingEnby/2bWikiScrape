## History
The event was held in a recreation of the Royal Albert Hall designed by [Franknificant](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Franknificant), which was built near the ruins of [Dark Souls Castle](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dark_Souls_Castle). A series of guests was formally invited to the location. Franknificant independently shared the location with other players such as [Dima788](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dima788) and [Jakethasnake52.](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jakethasnake52)

During the event the server shut down randomly, forcing the organizers to continue it at [Toro’s Theater](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Toro%E2%80%99s_Theater) on [The Archive](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Archive_(server)).

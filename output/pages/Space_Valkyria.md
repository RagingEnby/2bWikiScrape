**Space Valkyria** was an End base that was built by [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa). It is perhaps the most notable End base in 2b2t history, along with its successors [Space Valkyria 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_Valkyria_2) and [Space Valkyria 3](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_Valkyria_3).
## History
Before 2015, [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa) had attempted to make an end base, but because of an abundance of activity in the end, he always had to call it off in fear of others finding and griefing his base. But during the [3rd Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/3rd_Incursion), attention was turned away from the end, meaning Jack could build an end base without anyone noticing. Construction was mainly made possible because Jacktherippa had several infinites; rare [glitched blocks](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hacked_Items) which were able to be placed endlessly, without running out. As the base steadily progressed and expanded, Jacktherippa started to invite more players to his base. [Pyrobyte](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pyrobyte) gave Jack various [player heads](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Player_Heads), which he displayed on armor stands at the base. The only known person who had found Space Valkyria other than people invited before the grief was [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit), who accidentally found the base in 2015 while using a slime block airship. After he took a look around, he continued his journey into the End for his own project, the DFC.

In late May 2015, while [Pyrobyte](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pyrobyte) was AFK at the base, the [/msg coordinate exploit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coordinate_exploit#%2Fmsg_coordinate_exploit) was used on him, and [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013), [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob) and [taylo112](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/taylo112) arrived at Space Valkyria and griefed it. Once the server updated to 1.9 in April 2016, [c1yd3i](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/c1yd3i) and [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) re-griefed and withered the base on their way to grief [Space Valkyria 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_Valkyria_2). The two griefers, using [iTristan's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan) [backdoor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backdoors) access, teleported to Space Valkyria almost instantly. Almost all of Space Valkyria was destroyed beyond repair, and it was destroyed even more over the next few years, with the base almost unrecognizable today. The [4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_4th_Reich) also paid a visit to Space Valkyria and griefed its remains as much as they could. Jack, however, gave out an un-griefed world download for the general public in Fit's short cinematic video on Space Valkyria.

### Operation: Treasure Planet
Space Valkyria was originally conceived before End portals were re-enabled on 2b2t under the title Operation: Treasure Planet. The objective was to create a base that was impossible to find. Using hacked end portal frames, a portal was placed in a hidden location. Being one of few active end portals on the server at the time, it severely limited possibility for griefing until end portals were re-enabled.

## Architecture
This base contained many floors, all of which served a specific distinct purpose. Its lighting system was unique, consisting of beacons hanging from the ceiling as a light source, as well as more traditional ways such as torches or glowstone. The uppermost floor consisted of multiple farms and an Overworld-like environment. The uppermost level also contained a large length of glass, reaching from the central tower to the borders of the outer wall. This was the beginning of a dome that was to cover a biome filled with trees, but it was not completed before the base was griefed in 2015.

## Trivia
* [Space Valkyria 3](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_Valkyria_3) shares many design elements from the original Space Valkyria, including the general shape.
* Although the dome on top of Space Valkyria was never built, a similar dome was built at Space Valkyria 3 that contained a biome filled with plants and mobs
* Space Valkyria was one of the only bases with unnaturally placed bedrock.
*An attempt to rebuild the base was made by [Goujon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Goujon) and some friends in late 2020, but the base could not be completely rebuilt as it was griefed before completion.

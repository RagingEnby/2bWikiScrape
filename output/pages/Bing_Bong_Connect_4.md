}}**Bong Bong Connect 4** was a collaborative board-game competition event run by [Sven_Sven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sven_Sven) in early 2023. It was initially griefed by [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer), (who misunderstood its locations to be BSB bases) and causing the [Connect 4 Drama](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Connect_4_Drama), although the event also later occurred and resulted in a win by [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association).

## History
Sven_Sven created the Bing Bong Connect 4 event after a discussion with [KitNightingale](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KitNightingale) over event ideas for 2B2T. They worked out designs for various redstone gameboards and concepts, some of which dumped lava on the losing players. Several large groups on 2b2t where invited to submit a 2-man team to participate in the event, with Noxshop later brought on to sponsor the event and provide the rewards. RICELAND1 was brought in to design The main staging area of the event, with Enigma_008 designing music machines for the stages. Construction on the arenas began, with 2 of the 3 being nearly completed.

The event was griefed the day before it was due to take place by [Donfuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer), who griefed the two primary event bases under the impression they were BSB bases. This lead to Donfuer being disqualified from the event, in addition to the self-grief of a BSB recruit base and nearby promotional Connect 4 mapart, as well as the retaliatory grief of [Dreifuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/trifuer) by [BSB](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BSB). After a delay the next day, the event continued, utilizing the 2nd [Fight Club](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fight_Club) arena (A giant obsidian volcano), as well as the Nether Wart Base by X. [2b2t.group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t.group) had to withdraw from the event as none of their members were able to log in at the time as the queue was unusually long during that particular week, owing to a recent [video critique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jStEw-VtN7w) of the 2B2T queue system by [SalC1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SalC1).

### Qualifiers
The qualifiers were located within a giant obsidian volcano. During the start of the event, [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) and [Jamba Juice](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jamba_Juice) were added to the roster. this led to there being 10 teams on the roster. As there were more than 8 teams, there were qualifier rounds run before any proper elimination table was made.

These qualifying rounds were rather confusing, ending after the [Obscension](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Obscension) team had to back out during qualifiers due to a lack of online members, and the [Cakemasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cakemasons) team, after losing 2 rounds, requested the qualifiers be cut short by eliminating them early, leading to a cleaner event of 8 teams.

### First Round
In the first round, [Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column) won against [HWU](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HWU), Jamba Juice won against the [Collective](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Collective), [SBA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SBA) won against the Astral Brotherhood and BSB won against [Bookhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bookhood).

During the First Round, [Dima788](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dima788) was kicked from the Fifth Column because he wouldn't leak [Orsond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Orsond) coordinates to the arena, and had also told everyone that the Fifth Column had been asking for the co-ordinates, leaking their presumed intent to grief the event. As Dima was the lone competitor for 5C, it was decided they would be able to remain in the event under "Team Dima", effectively disqualifying the Fifth Column and replacing them with Dima as a one-person team.

### Semi-Finals
The semi-finals moved the event to a Nether Wart hedge-maze dome. Here, SBA won against BSB and Jamba Juice won against Team Dima.

### Finals
In the finals, SBA won against Jamba Juice. For winning, they would receive 5 double chests of materials and 4 shulker boxes of [illegals](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Illegal_items) from Noxshop. Shortly after the finals, Dima and BSB competed for "third place", with Dima ultimately winning.

There was a brief after-party, in which the events of the day were discussed. At the conclusion, [maksitaxi](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/maksitaxi) gave everyone warning that he would return to PVPing within half a minute, blowing up the middle of the arena and beginning to PVP with stragglers once done counting down.

## Aftermath
{{See also|Connect 4 Drama}}
Though the event was rather small and inconsequential in and of itself, the actions taken against it by [Donfuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer) had a greater impact. After the event, Donfuer received some community backlash in the form of base coordinates being leaked to [BSB](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys) or [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood), which resulted in several griefs, such as [Lemuria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lemuria) and Donfuerâ€™s Constantiam base. The Astral Brotherhood implemented a ban on applications from current Donfuer members. Some members of Donfuer would leave the group. In response, [D_loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_loaded) issued an apology, and implemented a purge of inactive members retaining only around 40 people. In the following months, some of the higher-ups returned and Donfuer recovered from the drama and griefs.

The Connect 4 event also later served as an inspiration for a similar Connect 4 event hosted by the Astral Brotherhood about a year later

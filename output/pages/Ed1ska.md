**ed1ska** (more commonly known as **Edik**) is a builder that joined in 2021.
## History
ed1ska joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) on 24 July, 2021. He wandered spawn before meeting [tryptacraft](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/tryptacraft), with whom he built a starter base 300k out. Growing bored he first stopped playing a few weeks, then toured ruined bases. While at the [Monastery](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Monastery), ed1ska met [narnar](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/narnar), who invited him to [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association) for a time. He was also temporarily a [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) member in 2021. He left to play [Constantiam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Constantiam) for several months, before returning to build with the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) in 2022, first at [Sisterhood 1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#April_2022_Expansion), and later at [Solaris](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Solaris), [Polaris](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#-aris_bases), and [Stellaris](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Stellaris), largely thanks to [Osmobyte](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Osmobyte). Following the grief of Stellaris, ed1ska returned mostly to Constantiam. ed1ska throws a yearly Christmas party at spawn.

in 2024, Ed1ska was invited by [Max1mumChr1s](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Max1mumChr1s) to build at [The Hidden Vale](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Hidden_Vale) due to them both building at several bases together on Constantiam. He helped to excavate some small areas of the base, and trolled the chat while he was online.

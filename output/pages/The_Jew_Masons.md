**The Jew Masons** were established in May 2019 as a humorous response to the [Spawn Masons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Masons)' quest for Discord Boosts. Initially a meme group, The Jew Masons eventually evolved into a fully-fledged private group.

## Overview
The Jew Masons were founded by [v999](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/v999) and [FarmerJoe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FarmerJoe) after the Spawn Masons made their Discord public in an effort to boost their server. Those who provided boosts were rewarded with a "Scout" rank, access to coordinates for a new "Spawn Mason Scout" base, and additional permissions on the server. The Jew Masons, on the other hand, facetiously offered paid membership ranks, some priced as high as $300, to satirize the Spawn Masons, although these ranks were often given free to the leaders' friends. Members of The Jew Masons promoted their group in the Spawn Mason Discord and various other 2b2t Discord servers, rapidly attracting several hundred members.

However, when the Spawn Mason Discord was closed and non-paying members were banned, The Jew Masons became inactive, and interest waned. Later, [HighAtWork](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HighAtWork) took ownership of The Jew Masons (Revamped). However, shortly after [HighAtWork](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HighAtWork) left the Brownmen and one of the Discord admins had their account compromised, leading to a server raid. Nevertheless, [HighAtWork](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HighAtWork) revived the server on 11/12/20. Unfortunately, the group was disbanded on 7/18/21.

## The Nuke
After a year of the group's activity, a member named [Infisrael](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infisrael) gained access to Discord admin privileges. Shortly afterward Infisrael Discord account got hacked and the group's 800+ member Discord server was completely wiped in a nuke. This event led to a period of inactivity for the group until [HighAtWork](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HighAtWork) revived it.

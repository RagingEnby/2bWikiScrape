## History
In July 2017, dragonworm joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) with his real life friend [MikelAx7](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mikelax7). The two joined during the 1.12 [Temp map](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Temp_maps), and became members of [Highland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highland). During this time, they would create their first base, known as Time Valley Base. In September, dragonworm left Highland and leaked a spawnbase of theirs. He then joined [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) in September 2017, after meeting [D_loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_loaded) through a YouTube stream. During Decemeber 2017, dragonworm joined the [Vortex Coalition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vortex_Coalition). He participated in multiple small DonFuer bases, until he founded his own group with MikelAx7, known as the [Azerian Federation](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Azerian_Federation). He left [the Vortex Coalition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Vortex_Coalition), as they forced him to either disband his group, make it a subsidiary to VoCo, or to leave. dragonworm built a base known as Castle Rock for the group, which was later griefed because [Smackattack86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Smackattack86) was there. Due to the [6th incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/6th_incursion), he left 2b2t until August 2020.
Returning with the intention of continuing DonFuer on 2b2t, dragonworm built at several DonFuer bases, the most notable one being [DonFuer 20](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_20). It was at this time he joined the [0Neb Appreciation Group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0Neb_Appreciation_Group) and the [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate). Through the Shortbus Caliphate, he joined the [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen) discord and built at such bases as [Adamantium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Adamantium), [Mediano](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mediano), and others. dragonworm became a Guardsman in June 2021 at the [The Homeland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen#_The_Homeland).

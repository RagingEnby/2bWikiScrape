The **Phobos backdoor** was a large-scale malware distribution perpetrated by the **Phobos client** developers through public release of their client's code. While initially launched in revenge of their client's code being stolen by [The Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium) and related parties, the malware payload was distributed significantly farther and impacted large numbers of  PvPers in both the 2b2t community, in addition to those of other anarchy servers. The version 1.5.4 of the [hacked client](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cheat_Clients) contained a Remote Access Trojan (RAT).  Which uploaded the user's *Minecraft* passwords, Discord token, Chrome passwords, desktop screenshots, and computer files to a remote server. The coordinates to many bases were obtained and leaked, and the developers had access to the personal information of thousands of players.

## History
Originally, Phobos was a normal private hacked client, the developers being 3arthqu4ke, Crystallinqq, oHare, and Megyn. Hand chosen individuals used the client for its advantages in [crystal PvP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/crystal_PvP). Travis, the developer of [Wurst+2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cheat_client#sUncommon_hacked_clients), and other known [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium) members attempted to steal the client's source code. The efforts were eventually successful when Crystallinqq's Discord account was token-logged using a version of Wurst+2 leaked to him containing a token logger. Phobos members would make version 1.3.3 public through Discord to prevent Emperium using it privately, people would soon reupload it to Github.

However, to get revenge, a new, better version of the client was "leaked" by Phobos, which included the now known backdoors. These backdoors retrieved information from the user's computer. Despite the source code still being public, the backdoored code was hidden deep inside and went unnoticed. The backdoored client was run over 4,000 times across the server in under 48 hours.

[0x22](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0x22), a known programmer and client developer, discovered the backdoors after searching through the code for a few days. It was discovered to be able to steal Discord tokens, *Minecraft* usernames and passwords, and Google Chrome usernames and passwords. After the discovery became public, the developers immediately removed the backdoored code to avoid trouble. However, the damage had been done; countless bases were compromised, and personal information was collected. The developers were also able to obtain private clients from peoples' computers. Griefing began shortly after the discovery, with developer Megyn providing coordinates of many bases to [Team WAO](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_WAO). The impact was widespread, killing The Emperium and affecting many other groups. Many victims reported the developers to the FBI, and archives of the backdoored code were made.

Phobos continues to be a popular client for its hacks, with users downloading clean versions of the client.

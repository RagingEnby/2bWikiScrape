The Infinity Incursion Spawn logo was started in November 2019.

## History
The logo was located southwest of Spawn and took the shape of an infinity logo. It consisted of almost 590 thousand blocks of obsidian. Upon completion in December it overshadowed the logos by Armorsmithâ€™s Followers and the Spawnmasons in size. It was merged into a bigger obsidian sky roof during [Project Dead](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Project_Dead).

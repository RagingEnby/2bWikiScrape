**Sun_Wukon** is a player that joined in early 2016, before [June First](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rusher_War). He rose to prominence in late 2016, famously becoming known as "The Lag Machine Guy" due to a comment made by [TheCampingRusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) about his simple but highly effective lag machine design that hindered general gameplay for months in late 2016. He was a member of [The 4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_4th_Reich) and the [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons), and also helped in the [+Z Digging Group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/%2BZ_Digging_Group) before going inactive in 2018. He returned briefly in 2022 to build at [Corner Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Corner_Base) before leaving the server again.

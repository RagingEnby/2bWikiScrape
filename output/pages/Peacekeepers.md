**The Peacekeepers**, also known as PK, are a group on 2b2t that started on July 8th, 2016 when [PandaSauceYT](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/PandaSauceYT) started a series on his channel with the word "peacekeepers" in each episode. The group spawned from the various attempts by new players to create a sort of "third party" of neutrality during [the Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/the_Rusher_War) that would "keep the peace" and attack both [Team Rusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Rusher) and [Team Veteran](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Veteran) as a means to end the conflict. As the war escalated, the Peacekeepers began gaining attention as a legitimate group by both [Rushers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Rusher) and [Veterans](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Veteran). Eventually, the Peacekeepers abandoned their third party/neutrality ideology and sided with [Team Rusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Rusher). The Peacekeepers became somewhat of a sub group of [Team Rusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Rusher) as Napkin0fTruth, [TheCampingRusher's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) friend and rival, decided to defect from [Team Veteran](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Veteran) to the Peacekeepers. From then on, the two groups worked together and Rusher gained his first god gear from a Peacekeeper dupe stash, given to him by Napkin.

## Post-War
The Peacekeepers were the last active "pro-Rusher" group to still roam the server after the war, continuing on into conflict with the 4th Reich and Team Aurora. The conflict settled down after the 5th Incursion, with the group eventually leaving the server for about 4-5 months to play on other servers.

Eventually, on March 19th, 2017, PandasauceYT and the rest of the peacekeeper hierarchy returned to 2b2t. They would become a  PVP group at spawn and continue the bitterness and trash talk towards Aurora. This would lead to the two groups griefing a base from one another. Once Aurora started to become dormant, the Peacekeepers decided to make a small spawn base but was griefed.

In early 2017, the Peacekeepers had figured out how to perform the [donkey dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Duplication_glitch) and decided to begin duping with some members of the [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons). However, the Peacekeepers found out the Masons were plotting to eventually inside the stash. This event would begin hostility towards the SpawnMasons, eventually leading to conflict during the summer of 2017. The first battle occurred on June 4th, 2017, when the Peacekeepers ambushed [torogadude](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/torogadude) at spawn, causing him to combat log, eventually resulting in a large fight between both groups. The SpawnMasons would retreat because [FitMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FitMC) had ended his livestream in which he was filming during the battle. Both sides would have a different opinion over the outcome of the battle as the Masons had successfully escorted torogadude to safety however fled the attack. These confrontations would continue at spawn until the Spawn Masons disbanded in August of 2017 due to inside conflicts.

After the Masons disbanded, the Peacekeepers would continue to gain more control over spawn and eventually start to have hostilities with the rising Emperium. The Emperium claimed to have insided the Peacekeepers and cause the creation of a splinter group known as the Order of Lucifer, however this group was created by the the founders' own volitions. During this time, the Peacekeepers changed their ranking system and kicked a large portion of their members.

A small conflict also began to build up with Highland. The Peacekeepers disliked a leader of [Highland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highland) at the time, [DieloTai](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DieloTai), however, the groups only fought when Highland deliberately gave up their spawn camp coordinates so they could move and make a new one. The Peacekeepers arrived at the camp while all the members were afk and resulted in a fight in which all Highland members were killed except for DieloTai, who fled.

After these series of conflicts, the Peacekeepers slowly became ghosts of their former selves. Many members became inactive or quit 2b2t and those who remained went solo. [IHackedWalmart](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IHackedWalmart), already a high ranking member in PK, helped [Metrez](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Metrez) and many others dig the -X highway in late 2017. In early 2018, [AlphaCentauriA1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlphaCentauriA1) made a group for the remaining active members, the Saviors, and made IHackedWalmart a leader. The Saviors did not last long as the members joined the recently reformed Infrared as IHackedWalmart was a co-leader. The Saviors discord was deleted two months later for seeing little to no activity. What remained of the Peacekeepers joined the [Alpha Alliance](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Alpha_Alliance), along with [Infrared](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infrared) and Highland, as a rival of the [United Group Embassy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/United_Group_Embassy). Highland and PK allied due to this common enemy and put their old past behind them.

## Small 2018 Revival and Dissolution
In November 2018, Pandasauce quit 2b2t and handed over leadership of PK to IHackedWalmart. For the first month of PK under Walmart's leadership not much activity happened except Walmart inviting some friends of his who were in Highland, such as [bigbullet](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/bigbullet). After some drama with [Iridium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infrared), Walmart decided he would actually do something with PK. He made the discord and began to let in more members and made bigbullet a leader alongside him. Iridium later disbanded with Retronaut later joining the newly revived PK, that revived on December 16th, 2018. However, PK never came of anything in 2019 and beyond as it is now simply a meme and mostly disbanded.
## Relations
* [Team Rusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Rusher) - The relation between Peacekeepers and [Team Rusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Rusher) was strong due to [Rusher's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) friend and rival, [Napkin0fTruth](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Napkin0fTruth), joining the group. Napkin claimed that "the Peacekeepers were 90% with [Rushers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Rusher) and 10% with [Veterans](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Veteran)".
* [Team Veteran](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Veteran) - Despite Napkin's claim of the Peacekeepers "being 10% with the Veterans", the [Veterans](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Veteran) considered them as an enemy. [Team Veteran](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Veteran) especially wanted revenge on Napkin for leaving their group.
*[Resistance](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Resistance) - The relation between the two teams remained relatively neutral throughout the war until about the end of the war when Napkin had a dispute with the [Resistance](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Resistance) member GoDzOneManArmy. The dispute resulted in some bitterness between the two, however no sort of attacks were conducted against each other.
* [Team Aurora](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Aurora) - Team Aurora instigated attacks against the Peacekeepers in the late days of the Rusher War due to one of Neda T's friends being kicked from the Peacekeepers. The two groups would begin fighting each other along with the 4th Reich. When the Peacekeepers returned in March of 2017, they continued hostilities with Team Aurora as they conducted raids against each other.
* [The 4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_4th_Reich) - The two groups were enemies due to the Peacekeepers siding with the [Rushers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Rusher) and they continued to fight after [The Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Rusher_War) along with Team Aurora. The Peacekeepers, however became allies with The 4th Reich after the conflicts.
* [The Blind Eye Clan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Blind_Eye_Clan)  - The Blind Eye Clan had attempted an alliance with [Team Aurora](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Aurora) and the Peacekeepers. However, these plans never came to fruition due to 4th Reich intervention.
* [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Masons) - Peacekeepers were enemies with the SpawnMasons due to oldfag hate from [the Rusher War.](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Rusher_War)
*[The Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium) - The Peacekeepers were enemies with the Emperium due to several fights between them and the Peacekeepers affiliations with the Alpha Alliance .
*Alpha Alliance - A member of the Alliance and allied with all groups involved.
*[Infrared](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infrared) - Allied and several exchanged members.
*[Asylum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Asylum) - Allied at first then became enemies in the UGE vs AA war.
*[Highland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highland) - The Peacekeepers disliked Highland for a long time, but became allied due to the Alpha Alliance and exchanged members.
*[Team Rainbow](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Rainbow) - Despite initial hostilities with Team Aurora, the Peacekeepers became allies with Team Rainbow in the Alpha Alliance

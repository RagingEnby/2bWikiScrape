}}**New Argonath** was a [Last Templar](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Last_Templar) base founded in November 2019 after the self-grief of their previous base, [Argonath](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Argonath).

## History
### Foundation
New Argonath was founded on November 11, 2019, after [Argonath's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Argonath) discovery by [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium) and subsequent self-grief.

### Construction
The base was constructed over a period of just under 2 years. The majority of the builds (such as the archways, cathedral, and Founders Temple) were designed by King_Aurelius. [GSlick](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/GSlick) built a castle, [Jumbo_Warrior](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jumbo_Warrior) built his 'egg dog float', [Slamo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slamo) built his inverted pyramid, [Zknites](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Zknites) built his airship, among many other builds by a variety of other builders. [LaiZBoi](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/LaiZBoi), SalC1, and Slamo also helped King_Aurelius build a variety of his builds.

### Grief
New Argonath was located by [Nerds Inc](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc) using [Nocom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nocom). Its coordinates were briefly posted on r/2b2t along with 2 other bases in June 2021 by [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan), before [leijurv](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/leijurv) convinced him to remove New Argonath's coordinates from the post. leijurv continued to shield the base from being leaked for months after Nocom became public. [c1yd3i](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/c1yd3i) gained access to the Nocom database from [fr1kin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fr1kin), and began to sell coordinates from it. c1yd3i offered to sell New Argonath to [Crystallising](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crystallising) (who incidentally was a former Last Templar member), who warned SalC1 about the base being compromised. The members (largely LaiZBoi and King_Aurelius) rushed to complete the main arch at the base's entrance, and then the base was publicly leaked afterwards. [handyman_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/handyman_) griefed the base later that day.

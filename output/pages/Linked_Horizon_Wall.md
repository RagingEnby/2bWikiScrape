The **Linked Horizon Wall** is a circular obsidian wall around 2b2t's spawn.
## Purpose
[OMEGAO000](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/OMEGAO000) started the Linked Horizon project on January 4th, 2021 with the purpose of creating three circular obsidian walls around 2b2t spawn in the style of the Japanese anime [Attack on Titan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Titan). However, after just a single day of construction, it was clear that only one wall could be realistically built. [IronException](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IronException) suggested a radius of 2048 blocks, which he had previously determined to be just over 2b2t’s spawning radius. Construction on this three-block-thick, bedrock-to-build-limit wall began on January 7th, 2021.

## Construction
Construction of the wall was aided by IronException’s CircleChecker mod, which allowed for the visualization of the wall’s path.

Thanks to guidance from the [Highway Workers Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Workers_Union) and [EnigmA_008](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/EnigmA_008), construction methods changed over time, becoming more efficient and automated. Scaffolding and manual obsidian placement were partially replaced through the use of baritone selections. Ender chest breaking was also improved through scaffold/automine and fully automated with [KAMI Blue](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hacked_Clients) AutoObsidian. These techniques enabled fully afk obsidian placement for up to an hour, which helped prevent burnout during the four-month project.

Although top builder [Pyruuuu](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pyruuuu) continued placing manually using vertical scaffold, [futsin1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/futsin1), [badicope](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/badicope), [Transparent_Lube](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Transparent_Lube), and others used Baritone extensively. These techniques allowed just a handful of builders to keep the project afloat during times of relative inactivity.

## Result
On May 12th, 2021, 125 days after construction started, the Linked Horizon Wall was successfully completed. At 8.26 million obsidian, it is the third-largest obsidian structure on 2b2t, after the [highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highways) system and the [Masonic Eclipse](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Masonic_Eclipse). Over 100 players helped build the wall.

The project also resulted in the formation of the Linked Horizon group, now led by [futsin1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/futsin1), which aims to complete other spawn builds in the future.

During the completion a party was held to celebrate, where each player simultaneously placed the remaining obsidian. The last block was placed by [Pyruuuu](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pyruuuu).

}}The **0Neb Appreciation Group** was a group created to keep up with [0Neb's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0Neb) activities on 2b2t, and also to spread misinformation about [Nocom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nocom), with most of the group's members knowing nothing about the exploit's existence.
## History
The group was founded on 7 September, 2020 following a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/inz12n/my_big_reveal_i_am_xz_9/) by [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) claiming to be the owner of the AFK account [xz_9](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xz_9). Many players from a variety of groups were invited, such as the [Block Gamers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Gamers), [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate), [Nerds Inc](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc), [Spawnmasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons), and [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen). The initial goal was to simply keep up to date on 0Neb's activities, as she had been posting daily [Conspiracy theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory) about the '[Nerds Inc](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc) mind control calculator', US president [Lyndon B Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson), and xz_9. The suspicion concerning xz_9 and other associated accounts turned out to be correct, however, when it was revealed they had been used as a part of [Nocom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nocom).

Several 0Neb Appreciation group bases were founded and built through the Shortbus Caliphate, namely Funbase (also called Nokia base), Calculator 1, and Calculator 2. All three bases were built with reject blocks from the [Block Game Jerusalem](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Jerusalem) stash, and with as many players invited as possible that were active in global chat such as 0Neb, [pyruuu](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/pyruuu), and [Mad_King_Lambo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mad_King_Lambo).

Following the public revelation of [Nocom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nocom), the group's activities lessened considerably. Many members also became increasingly offended by 0Neb's racist behaviour. The group was disbanded on 10 October 2021 when 0Neb was removed from the Shortbus Caliphate and [Rat House](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rat_House) Discord servers.

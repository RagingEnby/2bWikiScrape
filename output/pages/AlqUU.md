**AlqUU** is a builder, base hunter, exploiter, and griefer.

## History
### -Z Northern Highway
AlqUU first joined 2b2t in November 2021 after he came across a video on YouTube that discussed the [Northern Overworld Highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Overworld_highways). Wanting to witness the server's history and community firsthand, he joined and immediately began making his way down the Northern Nether Highway and decided to expand it for 2 months.

### 2022
Rejoining 2b2t on June 22, 2022, AlqUU decided to contribute to the highway projects. After fixing highway segments and successfully applying, he joined [Highway Workers Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Workers_Union) and participated in several projects such as Widening Diagonal Highways, The Grid and Digging Diamonds. Notably, AlqUU has helped with supplying items and planning projects within the [Highway Workers Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Workers_Union). In late 2022, AlqUU helped construct the 2022 Halloween and Christmas Bases. Despite accusations of griefing several locations, he continued working on the Christmas Base and was involved in various griefing activities, including Bricktown, Christmas Base, Duck 3, Collective Hollowport, Donfuer spawnbase, and Headpop's stash. AlqUU carried out these griefs in collaboration with karpo0 and Jamba Juice. Following the griefs he would post a [now unlisted video](https://youtu.be/6Ji4s783jOk).

### 2023
In early 2023, AlqUU joined the [Jamba Juice](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jamba_Juice) group led by [Maksitaxi](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Maksitaxi). Alongside Jamba Juice, he participated in the SHA project to fill the Southern Canal with obsidian using baritone and highwaytools, he was the one who provided configs and methods to SHA to pave Southern Canal. After the conclusion of the Project, AlqUU's relationship with SHA Leader [Raptr_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Raptr_) soured, as Raptr_ attempted to steal AlqUU's and [karpo0](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/karpo0)'s stash. Raptr_ also formed a group called the [Highway Removal Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Removal_Union) with [ChiefBeekLoko](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ChiefBeefLoko). Their goal was to remove AlqUU from the Highway Workers Union.

In the end, AlqUU, together with the Highway Workers Union, managed to force Raptr_ and the Highway Removal Union to cease their activities. Despite repeated griefing attempts on highways near spawn, HWU members, alongside AlqUU, continuously repaired the damage and maintained the infrastructure. The persistent defense and swift restoration of the highways made it clear that the Highway Removal Union could not succeed in its goal. After a prolonged struggle, Raptr_ and his group abandoned their efforts, while AlqUU remained an active member of the Highway Workers Union.

Additionally, AlqUU joined a group project called [Inter-Dimensional Customs Control](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Inter-Dimensional_Customs_Control). The project aimed to restrict access to the End, allowing only certain players to enter the dimension. Players who did not meet the criteria were killed at End Spawn by the members of the group. Following the conclusion of the project, AlqUU was taught how to base hunt by [karpo0](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/karpo0), and experienced great success in the following weeks.

As 2023 began to reach its conclusion AlqUU focused on exploration and planning potential new projects.

### 2024
In early 2024, AlqUU befriended a player named [So1anum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/So1anum), and together with karpo0 and [XEHTAI](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/XEHTAI), they founded the group [129 Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/129_Boys). The group is notable for the abuse of a chunk regeneration exploit. AlqUU along with his group would use the regeneration exploit to acquire the Eye-Trim and distribute it to other players. They would also take advantage of the heavy impact on server performance to lag and crash 2b2t during this time.

### Hard ban Incident
AlqUU and So1anum were [hard banned](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ra2hyZWqzNk) from the 2b2t server due to causing lag. Both players were unbanned in the following 24 hours, but the regeneration exploit they had been using was patched. Upon their return AlqUUs inventory data had also been wiped.

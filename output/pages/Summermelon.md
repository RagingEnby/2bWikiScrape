**Summermelon** was a base founded by [Toshie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Toshie), [Vaxent](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vaxent), [aaron_alvin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/aaron_alvin), and [theloneloner](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/theloneloner) after [Wintermelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Wintermelon) was griefed. Later additions included [Offtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Offtopia), [Willyroof](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Willyroof), [CytotoxicTcell](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CytotoxicTcell), [Drud14](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Drud14), [Krobar01](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Krobar01), and [Todarac](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Todarac).

## History
Summermelon was one of the largest bases on 2b2t at the time. It was under construction for only 4 months before it was destroyed.

Sometime in May, [bigdon50](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/bigdon50) was invited to Summermelon and after a couple weeks, leaked the coords to [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit). On July 28th, 2017, [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyHku5duVvw) on griefing Summermelon for "revenge", with the help of [AlphaComputer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlphaComputer) and three others.

At the time, Fit and AlphaComputer were members of the [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons). However, contrary to popular belief, the grief was not executed (or even approved by) the SpawnMasons; it was Fit and AlphaComputer acting on their own. After the grief, AlphaComputer was voted out and Fit left (due partially to the fact that [Krobar01](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Krobar01) was in the SpawnMasons at the time).

After the town, most of the builders moved onto [Offtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Offtopia)'s flagship base, [Mu](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mu).

## Reason for Grief
The stated reason that Fit and his friends griefed Summermelon was because jddinger had the coords to [Rocket Town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rocket_Town) (Fit's sky base). BigDon, who was a member of both Summermelon and Rocket Town, leaked the coordinates to Fit because of this. However, jddinger was not a member of Summermelon, which would create speculation that Fit griefed Summermelon for views, though this was never confirmed.

}}The unnamed base colloquially known as **Corner Base**, **The Corner**, and other names, was base at the -,- End Corner in 2022 that was started by by [Harrissssonn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Harrissssonn), and included members of [Ancients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ancients), [Spawnmasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons), [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood), and [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association).

## History
### Foundation
Corner Base was started by [Harrisssonn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Harrisssonn) after he arrived at the -,- End Corner on June 12, 2022 after flying to the location from End Spawn starting on March 22, 2022. The trip took about 17 1/2 days (about 420 hours) of in-game time to complete, counting restarts to the journey. As a result of the time investment required to reach the End Corner, few others had been there before, excepting [Armorsmith](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith) (who had started [Armorland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorland) at the same corner in 2017), and [2v2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2v2t) (who had griefed Armorland later that year). The location was incredibly isolated as a result. Harrissssonn reached the corner and began to teleport his friends there using the [BoatTP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Travel#BoatTP) exploit utilizing end gateways. [F_i_l_i_n](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/F_i_l_i_n) was also teleported out and made a number of videos on Harrissssonn and Armorland, among other topics. Everyone (excluding Harrissssonn) that was at the -,- corner, got there through BoatTP.

### Construction
As more people were teleported to the -,- End corner, a base began to take shape as a result of builders including [smcz19](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/smcz19), [P529](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/P529), [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut), [Negative_Entropy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Negative_Entropy), [bread_loafs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/bread_loafs), and [_m_o_t_h_r_a_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_m_o_t_h_r_a_), among others. The base had no official name, and was colloquially known as 'Corner Base', 'The Corner', and other similar names as a result. Two [Spawnmason](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons) meeting were held there: June 25th's 'Throne of the Ancients' by P529, and July 2nd's 'End Balloon' by smcz19 and Joey_Coconut. Following the June 25 Spawnmason meeting, the attendants flew to Armorland and mined all Armorsmith's remaining builds using [Baritone](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone). In addition to these activities, more people were teleported to the base location, and more builds were made.

### Grief
The constant public discussion and streaming of the Corner Base resulted in [Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column) attempting to close off the End to prevent teleportation to the base. This was largely conducted through [maksitaxi's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/maksitaxi) [Interdimensional Customs Control](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Interdimensional_Customs_Control) group. 5c also attempted to convince a member of the base to leak. Those efforts succeeded in early July 2022. They griefed the base on July 10, 2022. Following the grief, 5c teleported many more players out to the -,- End Corner.

### Leak Controversy
Several months after Corner Base's grief, [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) made a [video](https://youtu.be/jlktcgxUWBY) which falsely blamed [BIKMUNNI](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BIKMUNNI) for the leak of the base. BIKMUNNI leaking was demonstrated to be highly unlikely after heated public discussion, followed by a Discord DM leak which further proved BIKMUNNI's innocence. The members of Corner Base blamed [zipoffs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/zipoffs) for the leak of the base, largely because of a self-stated willingness on his part to BoatTP the Fifth Column to the base with [badinek's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/badinek) help, although zipoffs furthermore denied actually BoatTPing 5c there.

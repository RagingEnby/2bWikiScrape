## History
### Early history
Clover first found out about 2b2t by googling for mature servers, hoping to contribute to a good community.

On joining 2b2t.org, she first escaped spawn by arriving on Hope Island at spawn, sustained on melons planted by a player named Zurisadai, and building on the island. There, she met [memeb0t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/memeb0t) (otherwise known as Netters or Z3m1), who shared a stash with her. During the temp map of April 2018, she and memeb0t met up with [StneCldKilla](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/StneCldKilla) who they went on to base with on the main map, creating the Dugout/Hause Base.

Later they joined the [Imperialists](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperialists_V.2) and built at their main base. Clover served as temporary co-leader in [2b2tRiotPolice](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2tRiotPolice)'s absence.

During the Sixth Incursion, Clover served as a WALLWORKER, WALL architect, and Schutzstaffel.

### Bases
She joined the [2b2t Builder's Guild](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Builder%27s_Guild), then [Builders Haven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Builders_Haven), basing at [Purgatory 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Purgatory_2), [Purgatory 4](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Purgatory_4), and [Exposition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Exposition) (Purgatory 5). After the grief of Haven's final stash, she and many other Haven members were invited to the site of [Valerian](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valerian). Clover built her magnum opus here, [Valerian Congress](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valerian#Congress).

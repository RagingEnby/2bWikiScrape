## History
]]
Jaang first joined 2b2t in 2011. He did not base with anyone or talk in chat. He worked on the Valley of Wheat, becoming the sole builder of it and spending his entire time building and expanding the Valley, never leaving it. Jaang allowed other players to take wheat from the sanctuary but wouldn't allow them to build anything in it. At some point while in the Nether, Jaang was attacked by another player but was saved by [Offtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Offtopia), who was one of the few players that Jaang interacted with. [Offtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Offtopia) would bring him gifts such as carrots and other new crops that were released. He would also protect the Valley, killing anyone if they did not replant.

Jaang would take long breaks, one lasting for an entire year. But in 2014, he quit. The valley was then maintained by Offtopia, who was also active with other bases, and could not defend the Valley of Wheat as effectively as Jaang. IMBJR and others griefed the base in 2015, and the place was left unrecognizable due to the Rusher invasion in 2016. The Valley was also griefed by groups such as [The Resistance](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Resistance) (who griefed the base for "fun"), [Rushers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rushers) (for not giving the rushers food) and [Team Veteran](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Veteran).

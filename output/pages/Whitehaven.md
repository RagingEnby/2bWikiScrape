**Whitehaven** was a large group base originally founded by jared2013 and orsond, but later led by [Krobar01](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Krobar01) for most of the base's existence, and was built in a medieval style that lasted around 10 months.

## History
### Founding of Teton
Whitehaven was founded by [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) and [orsond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/orsond) in August 2020 to 'test their compatibility as basemates', and was intended to be a somewhat short-term base. They immediately invited [Krobar01](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Krobar01) and [Yarnamite](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Yarnamite). The name of the base at that point was 'Teton', after the [mountain of the same name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Teton). Orsond quickly left, while jared helped Krobar with the beginnings of the castle. Yarnamite began his underground area, and later went inactive.

### Growth of Whitehaven
Krobar built alone at the location (now re-named Whitehaven) from September 2020 to January 2021, although in the interim he began talking to several members of [Block Game Jerusalem](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Jerusalem) about building there. While alone, Krobar built the majority of the central castle, as well as much of the surrounding farmland. After getting tired of building the base by himself, Krobar invited [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut), [Terbin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Terbin), and [Tanaxis](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tanaxis) to Whitehaven. After being added, Joey began to look for new members to add to the base, causing the further invitation of [Banana_on_2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Banana_on_2b2t), [gigo_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/gigo_), and [DocSmurf](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DocSmurf). gigo_ built his so-called 'evil tower' and Joey started his castle. Even so, the base kept rather quiet for several months, with Krobar and  Joey being the only consistently active members. orsond returned and began to build his lady. Terbin also began to build designs that DocSmurf and Tanaxis had created off of the server so that their builds could be at the base as neither were active there on 2b2t itself.

### Explosion of Activity
On May 4th, 2021, [Chiyun2b](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chiyun2b) found the base, and began stealing supplies and leaking the location, while denying these activities were taking place. After much discussion among the base members, it was decided that it was not time for a self-grief. Activity at the base exploded, with as much as 40% being added to the total size of the base in a mere 2 1/2 weeks. jared2013 returned to the base, and the final builders, ([Lunch_Katsu](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lunch_Katsu) and [Wailn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Wailn)) were added to the group. Yarnamite finished his underground area, Joey nearly finished his castle, the farms expanded nearly 1.5fold, Banana built a frontal castle in the front of Krobar's, Lunch_Katsu built his flower, jared and Yarnamite built jared's clocktower, Krobar and orsond finished the exterior of the lady, and Yarnamite built his lighthouse. After 2 1/2 weeks of this, the base members burned out. The base went mostly inactive by late May.

### Grief
On 16 June, 2021, jared2013 leaked the coordinates (along with those of Block Game Jerusalem) after months of heated disagreement with Joey_Coconut, and a recent conflict with [Nerds Inc](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc). Krobar, Yarnamite, gigo_, and orsond griefed the base before others could reach the location. In the window of time between Whitehaven's compromisation and grief, Krobar01 resumed activity at his base [Five Isles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Five_Isles), inviting many of the Whitehaven members shortly thereafter.

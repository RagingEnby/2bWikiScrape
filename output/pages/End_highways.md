**End highways** are the least developed and least useful [highways](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/highways) on the server, due to the fact that End travel is rare, (especially considering that it's hard to get in and out of the dimension) and even then it is done with elytras. The [highways](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/highways) are mainly defined by a series of ring roads that circle Spawn, as well as four axis highways that go out for around 100,000 blocks. Some of these highways were made out of ice or cobblestone using automated piston machines.

### +X
The +X Axis/Eastern highway is the least explored of all the highways in 2b2t. Its first 5000 blocks are made of obsidian, before it splits into a crossroad of four ice roads. A large chunk of the highway has rails that make it safer to traverse. The route has no visible terrain until x:7000. End Cities can be seen past the 14k mark and the nearest End Gateway is at around 19k. The area surrounding the highway is surprisingly pristine outside of the looted cities, griefed bases and strange player-made structures and signs, with large fields of Chorus growing in the islands. At 100k, there's a tunneled lavacast acting as a landmark. At around that point the ice ends and gives way to an Endstone road. Back in March 2023, the highway ended at x:178,000, but it might've been extended since.

### Recent Expansions
In late 2023, [BRABcraft](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BRABcraft) extended the +X end highway to 505k using a 1-wide path. It took him a week of afking to reach there.

Starting in early 2024, [Texy69](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Texy69) expanded the -Z end highway to 1,335,000 and the +Z end highway to 1,500,000. The highways are located around 100 blocks above the old ice highways and start at where they used to end. He used Ilmango's 12,000 per hour design that produced a 4 wide path with guardrails. The machine would break many times, and Texy69 would have to rebuild it up to 10 times a day. His goal for the +Z was to reach the end world border.

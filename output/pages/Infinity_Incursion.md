The **Infinity Incursion** (briefly known as **Infinity Incorporated**) was a group with the self-stated goal of preserving the tradition of Incursions on 2b2t, started by [BachiBachBach](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BachiBachBach). The Infinity Incursion constructed multiple large [Spawn Projects](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Projects), such as Operation Black Sky and the Fall 2020 watercube, before disbanding in August 2021.

## Structure
{{Tone|reason=Bold text is used in inappropriate places. The same with the underlined text. The text is probably taken from Reddit.}}{{Caption|A place that combines traditional Incursion events with large scale community projects.|[BachiBachBach](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BachiBachBach)}}
### The Community
"We preserve the tradition of Incursions on 2b2t." The Infinity Incursion was split into a <u>***group side***</u> and a <u>**community side**</u>. The original intention was to create a place where the community could relive the experience of <u>incursion like events.</u> Bachi: "I always found the most enjoyment on 2b2t when I was able to interact with the community - meeting new people, having an impact on the spawn region, enjoying the game." You didn't need to fill out an application when they announce spawn events, everyone was welcome as long as they respect the group and the other members. People that wanted to attend so-called 'Incursion Events' were granted the role **Reactive Incursioneer,** which was very fitting because the community side of ii acts reactive. It means that they only start incursion-like events whenever they feel a need for it. Trusted Reactive Incursioneer were granted the role of Trusted Reactive and had a higher chance of joining the group side of ii.

### The Group
Joining the group side of ii was different from joining the community side. **The group side was extremely important since they represented a reliable team to support the community side of ii**. The group had 2 main ranks: Infinity and Approved for Infinity. There was allegedly nothing such as rank grinding in the group, since "Infinity" was the highest obtainable role. They were essentially a tightly-knit community of friends and build up a team that they and the community side could rely on. The group and its members were the most important (game related) thing for every Infinity member. The group was the base of the Infinity Incursion since it was supporting every 'Incursion' event, making every event stable because of a healthy, supporting group. Other than that they did "normal" group activities like basing, stashing, playing other games - enjoying each other's company.

Spook Base was a series of bases created by the group called [The Infinity Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Infinity_Incursion) to celebrate Halloween.

## History
The **Infinity Incursion** was founded on the 11th of August 2019 by [BachiBachBach](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BachiBachBach). The Infinity Incursion is a result of the failed [8th Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Eighth_Incursion) which was led by [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) and [orchestrated](https://imgur.com/gallery/IYPim7W) by [Armorsmith](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith). BachiBachBach (also just called Bachi) who was jared2013's right hand during the 8th incursion was given full control over the discord and the project after jared2013 accepted his failure and left. Bachi restructured the old 8th Incursion Discord and stabilized the project within a few days.

Before he could take any action with restarting the 8th Incursion, jared2013 came back to delete the 8th Incursion discord server for reasons which are still unclear.

After jared2013's deletion of the original discord server, Bachi decided to establish a new one with the self-stated goal of "preserving the tradition of Incursions and repairing the damaged name of Incursions".

## Spawn projects
|alt=]]

### Infinity Incursion Symbol
The Infinity Incursion Symbol was created in November of 2019 at the height limit, southeast of spawn, and it was one of the largest [Spawn sky symbols](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_sky_symbols) and overall obsidian structures on the server at the time.
The goal was to make the infinity symbol seen on renders, As of the 11th October 2019, the infinity symbol was still the largest; larger than the [Armorsmith's Followers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith%27s_Followers) symbol and the original [SpawnMason](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons) symbol. This was until [The Masonic Eclipse](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Masonic_Eclipse) was completed, which dwarfed all other spawn symbols and cut through the infinity symbol.

### The Obsidian Sky
The Obsidian Sky was II's first massive project. The Obsidian Sky was 2050 x 2050 blocks big, it took 4 million obsidian to complete. The wall was not 2000 x 2000 blocks due to a miscalculation. The reasoning behind the obsidian sky was the make spawn dark to make it harder to see for new players.

#### Obsidian Sky statistics
* 589824 obsidian
* 73728 ender chests
* 1152 stacks of ender chests
* 43 shulker boxes of ender chests

### The Lava Curtain
The Great Lava Curtain was a massive barrier of lava around the entire spawn region (4000 x 4000), this was called an 'incursion', which was a smaller project to test newer members of the group. The lava was encased in an obsidian design that was hard to grief, so people couldn't just block it off. In total there was 48,000 lava sources placed. The lava wall project was completed in ten days, hence the nickname, "The 10 Day Incursion".
### The Water Cube
The Water Cube was a massive project undertaken in the fall of 2020. The goal was to create a water cube that was 1000 x 1000 to make spawn harder to escape. While the group was removing all the blocks in the 1000 x 1000 range, they found 2 illegally placed bedrock. This project gained massive attention from the community due to videos by the likes of [FitMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FitMC) and [Republic Radio News](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Republic_Radio_News). A program was created by [IronException](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IronException) to identify which water blocks were source blocks and which weren't to make the cube perfect. In total this project took around a month and a half to complete, creating over 250 million water source blocks.
### The TNT Cube
The TNT cube was 2b2t's New Year's event which took place on New Year's Eve 2020 and lasted into January 1, 2021. The first attempt failed when a creeper blew up the first cube, due to a structure that allowed them to Spawn. The next attempt no structure was allowed in the cube to stop this from happening again. The TNT cube was 100 x 100 x 100 big (1 million blocks of TNT), which took around 1 full day to build. The event went successfully, with the cube being ignited on New Year's Eve.

### Water Cube Expansion
This project began on June 25, 2021, to expand the pre-existing water cube, and to give members a project for the summer. The main goal was to expand the water cube to the 750 range of spawn. As a result, a conflict at spawn started where a group known as [The Anti Watercube Coalition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Gulag#Anti%2520Watercube%2520Coalition), a sub-group of The Gulag, rose up to attempt to stop the project. This and the Infinity Incursion's stash getting griefed lead to the project being suspended on August 17, and the group became private. A private announcement regarding the future of the group was leaked.

### Disbandment Of The Group
On August 22, 2021, BachiBachBach disbanded the group after 2 years, as he didn't have time to manage the group anymore. The discord server was officially archived the same day. The discord would be reused as the public discord for the [Bookhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bookhood), which many of the high ranking members would join.

## Bases
### Spook Base I
Spook Base I was the first base in the Spook Base series, created in October 2019. At the time the base was made, the Infinity Incursion was being insided by a group called Team Blackfyre. The insider, [TheWhiteWolf](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheWhiteWolf), leaked the base coords and they were griefed. The base lasted only 2 days and few screenshots of Spook Base I exist due to its short life span.
### Spook Base II
Spook Base II was made in October 2019 a week after Spook Base I was griefed. This base lasted significantly longer. It lasted around a week and there are lots of screenshots of this base. The most notable part of the base was the huge dragon in its center. But, nothing lasts forever. Another insider was in Infinity Incursion, and after getting access to the base, the insider leaked the coordinates through [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/dh3w6n/infinity_incursion_inside_spook_base_is_a_major/) Reddit post and it was soon griefed.

### Spook Base III
Spook Base III was created a few days after Spook Base II and lasted the rest of October 2019. It was the largest Spook Base and lasted the longest. Many more people joined the base. The insider leaked the coordinates to [The Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Backstreet_Boys), who then griefed it and made a video on it.]]

### Spook Base IV
Spook Base IV was started on October 9, 2020. This base included all members of Eternity and above. The base was built next to the ruins of Spook Base III, and was only about 25 blocks away. The base was leaked to [WomenAreObjects](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/WomenAreObjects) by the developers of the [Phobos backdoor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Phobos_backdoor) in late October, and griefed by him on October 23.

### Spook Base V
Spook Base V was started quickly after the destruction of Spook Base IV to last until Halloween. This base included fewer members than Spook Base IV to protect it from insiders. The base was griefed after it was leaked by [Frosty003](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Frosty003).

### Waternoose
Waternoose was the last base the Infinity Incursion founded, and later Book Hood. This base had countless members and was the longest standing base the Infinity Incurision ever had surviving through Nocom(a deal was struck between the base members and [Nerds Inc](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc)) and into 2b2t's update to 1.20. The base was griefed by MaksiTaxi in July of 2024.|276x276px|left]]
### George Harbor
George Harbor was the first spawn base created by the Infinity Incorporated Building Division in April 2021. The shortly lived building chief [Franknificant](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Franknificant) would bring new builders from the [Lost Nomads](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Lost_Nomads) to the Infinity Incursion. Frank would also influence the name of the base, George Harbor, based off a meme about a [George Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd) [Spawn Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Incursions). The base would become a popular hang out spot for members, and they would play Hide-and-Seek; as the small chunk island landscape allowed for unique hiding spots. The base included the Stromenland Lighthouse from [_Smokescreen_,](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Smokescreen) the S.S. I.I. by [SilverEyes](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SilverEyes100), a flying dragon from [beast_machine](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/beast_machine), a large boat by [Nameoner](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nameoner), and multiple houses from II members. Even a boat-house was built by [Franknificant](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Franknificant), which secret Hide-and-Seek spots were. Unlike spawn bases before, George Harbor was more of a place to chill rather than build. When [Forceken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Forceken) visited George Harbor, he would tell, "Right now there is not many builds here, but It reminds me of old bases on 2b, I see you guys in voice chat often and it seems its more of the community rather than for the builds (paraphrased from [Forceken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Forceken) in II voice chat)."

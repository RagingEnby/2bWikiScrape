**Stellaris**, originally known as **Stone Brick Sanctuary 2**, was an [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) base founded by [Berkoes](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Berkoes) and [KatzeFlocken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KatzeFlocken) on September 17th, 2022.

## History
### Stone Brick Sanctuary 2
Stellaris was founded on September 17th, 2022 as a sequel to [Stone Brick Sanctuary](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Stone_Brick_Sanctuary), and was originally named Stone Brick Sanctuary 2. After the coordinates were decided, [Berkoes](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Berkoes) and [KatzeFlocken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KatzeFlocken) terraformed the landscape into a mountain surrounded by flat terrain. A month later on October 26th, 2022, the coordinates were released to the other former SBS members. After the first few weeks, the base was mostly left dormant.

### Stellaris
On November 24th, 2022, Berkoes made the decision to merge the base group into the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood), and after discussing wit the new members, renamed the base to Stellaris. Following this merge, the base exploded in activity, with [Universin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Universin) finishing his castle, library within a few days alongside [Osmobyte's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Osmobyte) dimensional portal and [Ed1ska's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ed1ska) observatory. Activity began to slow after the initial escalation brought on by the new members.

Following the grief of the another [Meteorite](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Ranks) base, Taiyo, on January 3rd 2023, [RICELAND1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/RICELAND1), [TheSpire](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheSpire) and [AnimeTiddie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AnimeTiddie) were added to the base , sparking a second wave of activity. Anime constructed his modern suburb and park, while RICELAND1 started on his large canal pump, alongside many other members building a variety of small builds around the base. Universin also created a swamp village and redesigned Edik's observatory while Osmobyte finished his Zodiac temple and [Dom1405](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dom1405) built his military camp. Stellaris was griefed by the [Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column) on January 26th, 2023.

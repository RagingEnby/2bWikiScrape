**The Klansmen** was a group founded by epik with the intent to break the [Ziggy Town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ziggy_Town) comet. This group would later come into conflict with the [Anti-Bedrock Society](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Anti_Bedrock_Society) and fight at the [Battle of Ziggy Town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ziggy_Town).

## History
On May 9, 2020, epik started the comet breaking project with his initial group,  "2b's Satanic Cult". The idea was originally suggested by DeathBlessing and WoahSipper, and they helped break the bedrock with a very slow bedrock-breaking method. After a while, 2b’s Satanic Cult became inactive and the owners archived it. It should be noted that other groups and individuals helped break the comet before the Klansmen and Anti-Bedrock Society, including [househousehouse1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/househousehouse1) and the [4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4th_Reich).

After the Satanic Cult ended, epik made a new group. Originally called the KKK (Kool Kidz Klub, Kool Kidz Kabin, and Ku Klux Klan), it was supposed to be an anti-newfag group, but it became a group to break the comet. Epik started breaking it with Heliosphera and Miko. At the time, Azrn gave them a faster method to break bedrock. The Klansmen started to get attention and more people joined in on the project. On July 17, 2020, InvisibleXD joined and became the top bedrock breaker, breaking 1022 bedrock pieces.

Eventually the [Anti-Bedrock Society](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Anti_Bedrock_Society) would also start breaking the comet. They broke bedrock from the comet, however, according to the Klansmen, not as much as compared to the work Invisible or epik did.

On August 20, 2020, there were only a few pieces of bedrock remaining at the comet, so both groups went there to finish the comet. After almost 1 entire day of pvping and breaking bedrock it all came down to the last bedrock block. Eventually Team WAO defeated the [Infinity Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinity_Incursion) and allowed the Anti Bedrock Society to be in control of the final block and destroy it.

After Ziggy Town, the Klansmen would mostly become inactive and disband in late 2020.

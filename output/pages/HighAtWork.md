## History
### Brownmen and Associates
HighAtWork is a player who joined in 2019. After befriending [FarmerJoe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FarmerJoe), he quickly became a member of the group [The Jew Masons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Jew_Masons). Through his time and effort in the Jew Masons, he became a member of the [Brownmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Brownmen). He later became the owner of the Jew Masons. He also participated in The Bakery, The Quarantine, and No Server November 2 with the Brownmen.

HighAtWork became a member of [Elysium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Elysium) in late 2020, setting up shop at their newest base, [Elysium 3](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Elysium_3). Then, he was ratted, causing him to be removed from most of the groups he was in. He then left the server for a 5 month hiatus, occasionally checking in on his dying group [The Jew Masons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Jew_Masons). At the beginning of 2021 [SoiledCold](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SoiledCold) invited [HighAtWork](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HighAtWork) to one of his projects, causing HighAtWork to re-join the server fully around January 2021.  He also joined [BSB](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BSB) for a short time after making [SpergClub](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpergClub) with them.

Since then, he founded a new group, with the help of [Brownmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Brownmen), [Dima788](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dima788), [H202](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/H202) and [Catgurlmatty](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Catgurlmatty) called [The Enclave](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Enclave). A griefing group inspired by the same faction from Fallout 2, was created to fill the void during [BSB](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BSB) inactivity. Currently, they have around ~50 members and a couple of griefs. Such as: [July 10th Event](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/July_10th_Event) (also known as the Screenshot Event), [Cherrytown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cherrytown) and [Rusevo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rusevo).

### Mapart
Between 2019 and late 2020 HighAtWork got into making maparts, befriending [InvisibleXD](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/InvisibleXD) and soon making his first map. He then joined the mapart group [TEA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TEA).

## History
In late 2021, a player named [Hexw](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hexw) wanted to found a group to help newer players with getting started and to make friends. He would go on to meet, flixzit, a newer player who had a penchant for gathering players. Hexw and flixzit would go on to form Luminaria. During its early stages the group swiftly grew and earned their lasting reputation for being a haven for new players.

Early on, **Luminaria** would face challenges, one of the core members at the time Larry the Absolute Unit would invite a player who would result in the grief of their first base, Lux Island. Subsequently, the group created a new base, Treephobia, further out than their previous base. As time passed, Hexw would have disagreements with [flixzit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/flixzit), following this members would leave the group as a result of flixzit's influence. This disagreement would continue until eventually Hexw would create a newchat excluding flixzit. At this time, the majority of members transitioned to Hexw's new chat. They abandoned Treephobia and established a new base called Paradox.

After Paradox, [Hexw](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hexw), [Hexw](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hexw), [Fishy38](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fishy38), [Biglarry62](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Biglarry62), and [RLbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/RLbob) decided to embark on the creation of the Luminaria mega base. Named "Nox Town," this completely underground mega base featured various themed areas. Around one month after the base's establishment, Hexw initiated a building competition, with the winner, Afelot, receiving two months of free priority queue as a reward. However, only three months into the base's existence, Luminaria had to temporarily leave 2b2t due to concerns over a coordinate exploit. They relocated to 0b0t for safety.

During their break on 0b0t, Biglarry62 conceived the idea of running a shop for 2b2t, managed by the Luminaria Dragons. Upon returning to 2b2t, they discovered that the Nox Town base had been griefed beyond repair. Despite this setback, RLbob and Hexw decided to press on with the 2b2t shop concept. Under the stewardship of Qsp, Yofishiscool, and Senakot, the project took flight. Concurrently, RLbob initiated two new bases, a spawn base designed for duping armor sets and building, and a base for higher-ranking members. However, the spawn base's activity waned after a short period.

In a turn of events, Gravixous shared a video on March 19th, 2022, depicting a violent scene with Minecraft music, leading to his banishment from the group. It later emerged that RLbob had also shared the same video two months prior, casting a shadow over the group's integrity. Troubles deepened when Gravixous obtained the coordinates to Veritas and proceeded to destroy the base. Franknificant Who was a good friend of Gravixous sent the same video asking for Grav to be unbanned but Frank then got banned Himself but little did the the dragons know Frank had the coordinates to the Noxshop stash and quickly moved the stash. This event prompted the ejection of Larry and Bob from the Nox Shop for being friends with frank.

In the aftermath of these events, Luminaria experienced a period of dormancy. Larry and Bob took time to regroup, with Larry retreating from the scene for about a month. Eventually, the two friends reconciled their differences. Their determination to rebuild the group and their friendship set the stage for Luminaria's future endeavors.

## Ranks
Luminaria has five main roles, with four of them being inspired by 2b2t roles:

**The Dragons**: The Dragons are the primary leaders of Luminaria. There are usually five to six Dragons at a time in the group, with Hexw being the main Dragon.

**Moderator**: Moderators are the second most powerful rank in the group. They have authority within the Discord, but their powers don't extend to the group's leadership like the Dragons.

**Guardian**: At the peak of the group, many members held the Guardian role. This role signifies trustworthiness but doesn't grant as much authority as the Moderator role.

**Lightsworn**: Lightsworns are the newest members of the group, typically given this role after applying to join.

**Friend**: The Friend role is designated for those who are new to the Discord or are unknown to the Dragons, especially if they don't play on 2b2t.

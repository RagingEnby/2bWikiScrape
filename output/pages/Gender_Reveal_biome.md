Gender Reveal Biome was a project organized by the [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate) in September 2020.

## History
On September 9th 2020—on the 19-year anniversary of the terrorist attacks on the United States—the Shortbus Caliphate constructed ‘Gender Reveal Biome’, a biome consisting of 275000 blocks of TNT. It included a replica of the Twin Towers, with planes flying into it. The ‘base’ was eventually lit up, lagging the server. This record was broken just a few months later at the [1 million TNT detonation](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/1_million_TNT_detonation).

A time-lapse of the base has been constructed using data obtained using the Nocom Exploit.

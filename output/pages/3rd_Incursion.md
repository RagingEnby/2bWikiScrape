It started on the 28th of April, 2015, two years after the founding of Valkyria. This Incursion was also known for several exploits used, such as infinite blocks and mob spawning.

## History
On April 28th, 2015, [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86) announced the Third Incursion, made to vent the Valkyrians' anger over the leaking of [Asgard II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Asgard_II). A Forward Operating Base (FOB) was made at (-44700, 20300) and kept secret; It's purpose was to quickly resupply killed Incursion members. A volunteer base was made near spawn around a stone brick and water build made by Bammerbeast. It consisted of castles made of duped items like emerald blocks. However, in the timespan of April 30th to May 5th, Volunteer Base was destroyed and the members started to focus on making 7 spawn bases, each representing the 7 deadly sins. But one of the spawn bases, [Wrath Outpost](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Wrath_Outpost), looked so good that the entire incursion started focusing on that single base. The incursion used leftovers from previous dupes and infinite items to bring them the obsidian they need. A bedrock block was also placed in the middle of the outpost. A melon fort is also constructed by Kaorukun around May 6th to 8th.

For the next few weeks, newfags and players who tried to stop the Third Incursion were killed. Wrath was well defended by the dozens of Incursion members, making it virtually impossible for griefers to damage it - especially with withers disabled. Those who did attempt to storm and grief Wrath were killed or combat logged multiple times such as jared2013, [fr1kin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fr1kin), [taylo112](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/taylo112), [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob), [x0xp](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/X0XP), and iTristan (playing both sides). They would never succeed because Pyrobyte had a sword with a sharpness level of 666 and TNT with a negative value that would give him an infinite number of TNT, making it easy to destroy any lavacasts in Wrath. Jared, fr1kin and x0XP attempted to "invade" the outpost with an "army of bots", so a trench was made by the incursion to stop them. On an icy lake nearby, jared also fought [balonypony](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/balonypony), whom he usually fought with occasionally and was matched at PvP skills with. On May 25th, with the Incursion withering in activity, iTristan, popbob, and jared saw an oppurtunity to do real damage to Wrath and killed _Henry_. Within an hour, Sato, Nes (Fit), Cupcakest (balonypony), and BAHSAHKAH (Jacktherippa) mobilized against the 3; All except jared fled, who was the only player to fight.

By the end, the incursion was a humongous success. A few players such as [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) stayed at spawn for the next couple of weeks, but he eventually left.

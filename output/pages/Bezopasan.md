# Bezopasan

**Bezopasan**, previously known as **DrEnderPickles** or **jacobigrat**, is a prejune player, griefer and content creator. Currently he is an active member of the [Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column).

## History
### Early History
Bezopasan first joined 2b2t in the fall of 2014, under the name jacobigrat, after seeing it mentioned twice in a magazine called "The Advanced Minecrafter 2.0". However, due to lag, he did not play consistently until early 2015, instead opting to play [3b3t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/3b3t) (a clone server run by [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan) and [Pyrobyte](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pyrobyte)) instead. There, he encountered many players, such as [CainesLaw](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CainesLaw), [drewbookman](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/drewbookman) and [Branillon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Branillon), whom he based with, as well as [x0XP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/x0XP), who griefed the base the next day. He also met and interacted with [Victor96](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Victor96) at the 3b3t World Border prior to moving back to 2b2t. After migrating to 2b2t, Bezopasan was invited to [Shenandoah](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shenandoah).

### Membership in Shenandoah & Conflict with Valkyria
The base fell after a series of conflicts after Bezopasan invited the griefer [drewbookman](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/drewbookman). Even though drewbookman didn’t destroy the base, this damaged Bezopasan’s reputation. In 2015, Bezopasan spoke about the base while arguing with [Anonymoose](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Anonymoose) on 3b3t. Not long after, the player destroyed the base on 2b2t. The core members started a few new bases and were invited to the Valkyrian base [Asgard II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Asgard_II), which resulted in tensions between Bezopasan and various members of the groups such as [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86) and [_Henry_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_Henry_). In early 2015, Bezopasan established the [KOS Assassins](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KOS_Assassins), a group aimed at combating Valkyria and mocking Sato86. Bezopasan considered Sato86 his personal nemesis due to many former members of Shenandoah joining Valkyria, and for Bezopasan subsequently being put on the KOS (Kill On Sight) list during the [Third Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Third_Incursion). During the Incursion, Bezopasan was attacked by Incursion members including [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86) and [Henry](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Henry), resulting in his death; he was bedtrapped and quit for a few years.

### Return to 2b2t
In 2016, he became active on 9b9t; another clone that was gaining popularity at the time. He caused a variety of [Illegal items](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Illegal_items) to enter into circulation there. On 9b9t, he met [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) as well as [iTavux](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTavux), with whom he returned to 2b2t in 2018. It was also during this time that he changed his name permanently from DrEnderPickles to Bezopasan. In late 2018, Bezopasan started the DrEnderPickles Show, a series of interviews with various prominent or long-term 2b2t players. jared2013 was the first guest and has played a significant role at times, in selecting and contacting guests. Bezopasan also brought the KOS Assassins back, this time as a more organized PvP group. In 2020, the group targeted the [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen) and played a role in the attack on [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) during his initiation into the Guardsmen. Soon afterwards, due to drama, many members moved over to [The Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium), causing the group to stagnate. Later, Bezopasan temporarily joined the [Infinity Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinity_Incursion) and met a number of new friends, such as Smeek (whom he became close friends with), as well as [Jakethasnake52](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jakethasnake52) (whom  he was either friends with or in direct conflict with at various points since).

### Membership in the Fifth Column
After becoming better acquainted with [orsond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/orsond) after their past conflicts, Bezopasan joined the Guardsmen and soon thereafter the [Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column). In the Fifth Column, he played a prominent role in the Copenheimer Project, as well as the destruction of a wide variety of bases, such as [Skymasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Skymasons). In February 2023, Bezopasan was interviewed on the DigCast.

In October 2024, Bezo was one of the leaders of "Connect 5: Donfall", in which a former 'Elder' in [Donfuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer), [a1fastyellowgto](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/a1fastyellowgto), downloaded and leaked the discord chat logs and base coordinates of every discord and base that Donfuer had. He was one of the members of 5C who griefed every base that Donfuer had at the time. Bezo also published a video on this event, including his conversation with [D_loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_loaded) after the leaks occurred.

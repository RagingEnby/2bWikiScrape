**Ocala City**, also known as **Fancytown**, is a solo city base founded on June 13, 2017, by [Lifeisgood72](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lifeisgood72). Its architecture is based on Europe's 19th-century architecture.

## Timeline
*June 13, 2017 – Ocala is founded
*June 15, 2019 – [Lifeisgood72](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lifeisgood72) posted a screenshot on r/2b2t of the city with the debug screen purposely open, with the intent of the city to be griefed. The post was titled, "Moving on to a new era in my life. Go nuts." The coordinates were fake, however.
*October 12, 2019 – Lifeisgood72 logged in to find a player named "lieblingsrebell" at Ocala. After some talk, the player left without griefing the base.
*February 2020 – the base was found by a player named dansfilms. dansfilms sold the coordinates to several players in the [Vortex Coalition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vortex_Coalition), who looted the dupe stash but left the base intact. On February 18, he gave the coordinates to known griefer Soulbond.
*February 21, 2020 – Based griefed by Soulbond and Mr_Mcmine<br />

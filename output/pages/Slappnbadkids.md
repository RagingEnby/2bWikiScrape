## History
### Early History
AutismBot, also known as Slappnbadkids, which is the name of his original account, joined 2b2t in June of 2016. Whilst browsing YouTube, a video made by [TheCampingRusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) appeared in his recommendations. However, it was not until he watched a video by [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) that he decided to join the server. He played infrequently for the first couple of months, as the queue was enormous. His first few months on the server were spent exploring, and it was not until his wife, [JuicyBear](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/JuicyBear), expressed interest in joining the server that he actually began creating bases. When he killed himself to Spawn to help JuicyBear escape, he ran into a player by the name of [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut). He and Joey_Coconut quickly became friends and they would spend their time farming melons. They agreed to create a base together, but when Joey and AutismBot went along the wrong axis's, the plans for a base were put on hold. He spent a short amount of time exploring the nether with JuicyBear, and created a temporary base as he grinded for gear for a journey to 1,000,000. Once the pair reached 1,000,000, they established a small castle made of coal blocks, with plans for a permanent base. However, within a couple of weeks, they were invited to [Invictus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Invictus), and the base was abandoned.

### Invictus
Nothing of particular interest happened at Invictus, and the base was leaked to [Donster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donster) by [GetDroppedKids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/GetDroppedKids) shortly after their arrival. [Invictus II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Invictus_II) was the first significant base that AutismBot took part in. AutismBot was rather new to Minecraft at the time, and did not attempt to build "nice-looking" things. Instead, he created a two-hundred slot item sorter at the base, along with auto-farms, and a small villager-trading system. Whilst escorting a new member of Invictus II from Spawn, he noticed a misplaced portal with a bed in the nether. At the time, he had no knowledge of the bed teleportation exploit, and simply thought it odd. He approached the portal conclusively, and was greeted by the entirety of the abandoned La Rosa on the overworld side. AutismBot alerted his fellow members of Invictus and they made the decision to strip the base of all valuables. The valuables were then transported to Invictus.

Shortly after the raid of [La Rosa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/La_Rosa), player [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) was alerted by [C4RTM4N](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/C4RTM4N), a member of the La Rosa base, that it had been destroyed, and tasked him with retrieving the items. Whilst AutismBot was at Spawn, Jared invited him to restore a gold farm, and they became friends. At this point, AutismBot had no knowledge that jared2013 intended to steal his items. Since he had commitments at Invictus II, he decided to create the account "AutismBot," as a play on the account name "[BibleBot](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chatbots#BibleB0t)," and a legend was born.

### Ironfarm base & The Creative Mode Project
AutismBot quickly decided that the goldfarm restoration project was a bad idea, and befriended one of Jared's basemates, [fr1kin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fr1kin). He was invited to fr1kin and jared2013's [Ironfarm Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ironfarm_Base), a place where he would stay until after [11/11](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/11%2F11). Invictus II was leaked, and the follow-up base, [Obliviscaris](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Obliviscaris), lasted only a short amount of time. Obliviscaris was soon leaked to [NedaT](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NedaT) by a player named [TechReadyGamer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TechReadyGamer), with the base subsequently abandoned. AutismBot and JuicyBear moved their remaining items to Ironfarm Base. At this point, AutismBot joined the [4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4th_Reich), and participated in a number of griefs with them.

When the 11/11 duplication hit 2b2t, jared2013 had already scrapped his plans for the manipulation of AutismBot and truly befriended him. As a result, when Jared learned of the 11/11 duplication, AutismBot and fr1kin were some of the first players to be notified. Ironfarm Base became a hub of items, and stashes were created all around the base. Unfortunately, the largest stash was compromised and griefed by a player using [KnightVista](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KnightVista)'s account. In addition, smaller bases were found on the outskirts of Ironfarm Base, and so the base was abandoned. AutismBot was invited to [Ragnarok I](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ragnarok_I) by [0xymoron](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0xymoron), but, as 0xymoron had destroyed a base of the [4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4th_Reich), AutismBot leaked the coordinates to [Tim_Mcnukepants](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tim_Mcnukepants), and Ragnarok I was destroyed. AutismBot was also invited to participate in C4RTM4N's [2b2t Creative Mode Project](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Creative_Mode_Project), but soon after its creation, the player [Parthicus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Parthicus) was invited, and the base was griefed.

### BGM
Following the destruction of the 2b2t Creative Mode Project, AutismBot was approached by a player named [GanjMeisterBlock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/GanjMeisterBlock) with an offer to found a base. A short list of candidates was selected from the members of the 2b2t Creative Mode Project, with the additions of several friends that AutismBot had collected over the course of his time on 2b2t. [Block Game Mecca](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Mecca) was founded on January 1, 2017, and is considered by AutismBot to be the pinnacle of his achievements on 2b2t.

Around this time, JuicyBear decided to take a break from the server, and AutismBot was for the first time left without a building partner. He would initially focus on the redstone at BGM, and spent much of his time creating an item sorter, a gold farm, and a guardian farm. He eventually decided that the base was ugly and tried his hand at building. He built most of the cathedral, the UFO, the rustic village center, and helped with the Hitler statue. JuicyBear would return to 2b2t and assist in many of Block Game Mecca's group projects.

### Post-BGM
Following the destruction of BGM, AutismBot was a key player in the BoeMeccan witch trials, accidentally finding proof that Beardler had stolen Bodecken items. He also leaked a screenshot of Beardler leaking Jared2013's IP address, leading to the 2b2t Museum closing.

Following the destruction of Block Game Mecca on June 1, 2018, AutismBot convinced most of its members to start a base known as Aftermath. It was quickly decided that Aftermath was a "stupid plan," and it was abandoned entirely.

AutismBot went on to found [Block Game Jerusalem](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Jerusalem), shortly before quitting the server for two years. He returned to the base shortly before it was griefed, and then quit 2b2t shortly after because he was doxxed.

### Additional Information
AutismBot is known for having one of the first post-june 2016 bots to gain the acceptance of the greater 2b2t community. It spams a variety of offensive content, and includes commands such as !suicidetips, !insult (player), and !advice. It also has a !joinmessage command which functions similarly to BibleBot's.

## History
### Early History
DokiMin joined 2b2t on September 29th, 2019 after seeing [AntVenom's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AntVenom) video and related media on reddit. Throughout the rest of 2019, DokiMin played solo and wasn't part of any groups.

In mid-2020, Doki befriended [Digandbuilder](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Digandbuilder), which later resulted in Doki joining the Backstreet Boys. In late 2020, Doki had drama with [Infinity Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinity_Incursion) which resulted in an Infinity Incursion member posting images of Doki's face in the Infinity Incursion discord server. DokiMin took a short break from 2b2t.

### Membership in Backstreet Boys
DokiMin returned in March 2021, becoming a permanent member of the [Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys) due to his friendship with Digandbuilder after basing at [SpergClub](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpergClub). He ranked up very quickly from Recruit, becoming Mandem in February 2022. Throughout the year, he participated in griefs on [Gysdall](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Gysdall), [Azuros 3](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Azuros_3), [New Lugdunum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/New_Lugdunum), and [Alpha Town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Alpha_Town), among other bases. Doki also hunted stashes for much of the year. In January 2023, he solo griefed the Z+ world border base.

### Matrix Griefing Spree 2023
In 2023 [DokiMin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DokiMin) and [Nett](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nett) were disagreeing with the turn BSB had taken and claimed the group had been inactive and did not do anything with the coords that they gave the group. So with the numerous amounts of coords they had collected from insiders/insiding or just base hunting Doki and Nett will create a "group" called the [Matrix](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Matrix). They had larped that this group was [Brownmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Brownmen) x [Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys). They had managed to acquire insiders and and coordinates using the group [Matrix](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Matrix) . While on the outside members from both [BSB](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys) and [Brownmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Brownmen) believed this was a just a larp group for 7 months straight. Doki and Nett had went through many of bases they had stored and went on a massive griefing spree due to the lack of activity in there home group. The spree ended when Backstreet Boys higherups began to question what they were doing. Nonetheless Doki had made the message clear, and the group died down substantially

### 2024 Period of Inactivity
2024 was an off period for DokiMin, like most players life catches up quickly with the biggest burst of activity coming in Summer, though nothing incredibly notable happened during those 2 months of play. After the brief stint he went back to university.

### A Return
DokiMin has returned to 2b2t as of February 2025, with a friend and fellow BSB member Nettastini.

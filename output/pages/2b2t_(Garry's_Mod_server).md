**2builders2tools** (**2b2t**) was a *Garry's Mod* anarchy server founded and run by [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) in August 2008. It was founded after one of Hausemaster's friends, [Kalash](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kalash) (Reima), was banned from [2fort2furious](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2fort2furious) (2f2f), a *Team Fortress 2* server the two had played on. The server had its Steam group opened up on August 29, 2008. Hausemaster commonly experimented with mods and plugins on the server to terrorize the player base and let them have more stuff to play around with. The server was connected through www.2b2t.net (source engine required *www.* to be typed in) or through Hausemaster's old IP address (216.86.35.230:27015), which was advertised on Kalash's YouTube channel.

## History
{{See also|Timeline#Pre-2b2t|2b2t#Preface|Hausemaster#Early history|2fort2furious}}

The server was founded sometime in August 2008 after Hausemaster's past-friend Kalash was banned from 2f2f for using exploits. It was hosted by the 2b2t Steam group, which itself was named as a parody of 2f2f. The server was created as a sandbox server aimed at building in which players can do whatever they want. The Steam group for 2b2t was used by Hause for posting announcements.

In 2009, the server was having issues with long periods of downtime, and it constantly needed resets. Kalash helped maintain the server with Hausemaster but lost his adminship, alongside 11 other admins, in April.{{Quote|I broke the servers so many times. I think Housemaster weighed more of the cons on keeping me a mod because i cause as much grief as I do moderating|Kalash}}The demotion of 12 admins in the Steam group caused the group to be raided. The server went down sometime before [2b2t's *Minecraft* server](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) started in December 2010 as stated by Kalash, due to disinterest, but it is unknown when exactly this happened. It was up as late as September 18, 2010. In an archive from September 2011, the Steam group mentioned the *Minecraft* server as the only active one.

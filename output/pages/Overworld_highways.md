**Overworld highways** are used as travel for many new players who choose not to use the much more efficient [Nether highways](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nether_highways). There is only 1 organized group that focuses on Overworld Highways. Cardinals
{{Highways}}
The overworld axis highways were created by various players over the years. In 2014, [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) placed 4x4 obsidian paths along every axis, stretching out to 1,000. These paths were harvested for obsidian by [taylo112](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/taylo112) and [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) to create [Gold Farms](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Gold_Farms).

### +X
The +X Axis Highway is the most traveled Overworld highway, and for this same reason, one of the most dangerous. The original builders of the +X overworld highway are unknown due to the large amounts of griefing and destruction along the highway. The highway maintains a 3-wide road until around 15,000 out when it narrows down to a two-block wide path that follows the natural terrain generation with many unpatched griefs and withers that make traveling down the +X overworld highway very difficult. While traversing over large oceans, the path shrinks to one block wide then eventually opens up to 2 blocks wide when going over land. An underground highway running along the +X axis was formed to evade the withers and excessive griefing of the highway starting around 20,000 and eventually joining the main highway at 42,000. This section features many large [Vortex Coalition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vortex_Coalition) symbols built out of obsidian and approximately 50 blocks high. [Armorsmith's Followers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith%27s_Followers) and [Infinity Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinity_Incursion) symbols can also be seen throughout the highway that stands 8 and 12 blocks tall, with some of them being griefed. This highway also features many old ruins of bases that may date back to 2015, however many of the structures do not have a name or information on their original builders. Throughout the highway, decorated arches are used as random checkpoints along the highway and do not use any specific pattern. Around X:80,000, the highway narrows permanently to 1 block wide and is barely recognizable around natural terrain. Wukan's signs were also dispersed throughout the highway making smaller repair fixes and widening the highway on March 31, 2020. Around X:115,000, one of the only traceable highway builders, Mightymike8, built a section of the road to X:133,443 in December 2019. zBeyondix continued the highway in January 2020 until its current end as of June 2020. The original highway ended at 55,000 as of 2017. In June 2020, the +X overworld highway ends at 136,590, 0. However the highway was recently expanded to 500k in 2022. as of April 2024, the +X highway ends at 586,664.

The remains of several historical bases and settlements, like the [Valley of Wheat](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valley_of_Wheat) and the [Valley of Crafting Tables](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/List_of_small_bases) and countless others griefed over the years are near it.

### -X
The highway used to be one of the lesser developed of the overworld highways on 2b2t, with large sections of it just being a single strip of path block or cobblestone. There are very few builds on this road, the only one of significance being [the -10k Castle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewbP0tQISZg) which was heavily griefed sometime in late 2016/early 2017, with high wither usage. The 10k area has been griefed down to bedrock. The road also had large farm areas around both -3k and -12k, run by [leathernugget](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/leathernugget) and [General_21](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/General_21), which were destroyed in 2017. It also had a smaller farm area at -100k before it was griefed in April 2018. In May 2022 a group called Overworld Highways Association expanded the obsidian pavement of the highway to 15k

Season 7 of Doctrzombie's Advanced Minecraft series is an exploration of the -X axis as it was in late 2015.

[Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) made a video touring the highway in April 2020, garnering almost four million views. Back then, it ended at around X:-80,000, but was since greatly expanded. As of December 2024, the -X highway ends at -1,722,000. Known builders of the Western Highway are MoonflowerMC, waterman112, Skerjson, liquidwater, colebello,  AnchorOfTime, theblazehen, and Heinchecker.

### +Z
*Main article: [Southern Canal](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Southern_Canal)*

The +Z highway consists of the [Southern Canal](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Southern_Canal) from 400 to 1 Million (as of May 2025), originally founded in December 2014 by [ThebesAndSound](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ThebesAndSound). A paved road exists before the start of the canal.

### -Z
The highway is one of the oldest known, having been around since at least 2013. Thanks to The Overworld Highway Association, it has a quite high standard. Being two blocks wide and including side-barriers and staircases going on and off, made of primarily obsidian until 0, -15000. After this point, the overworld road drops into a poorly maintained road that is infrequently traveled which varies between 1 to 3 blocks wide. Past 100,000 blocks from spawn, the overworld road becomes a 1 block wide road that mainly follows the natural terrain of the world. The materials used on the poor condition road is mainly made of dirt, cobble, wooden slabs, and cobblestone stairs. The road from spawn to -700,850 was mostly built by Swervin777, however many of the road's builders closer to spawn are unknown due to the large griefing attempts that make the original makers of the road difficult to trace. Swervin777 built checkpoints on the overworld road every 5k, however many of the checkpoints have been griefed between spawn and 0, -300,000.
The overworld road features many older builds and farms, however almost all of the builds have been griefed or looted due to the location being on a main road. On April 8, 2018, ArchQuantum extended the overworld highway to -719,000. From -746,000 to -750,000, JabiDaJew built a path to commemorate the last few thousand blocks of the -Z overworld highway on Feburary 13th, 2019 (note that this original segment was not connected to the rest of the overworld highway built by Swervin777). Much later on June 4th, 2020, Greguhlicious completed the segment between -719,000 and -746,000 that connected the two fragmented pieces of the overworld road. From the -750,000 checkpoint, a horse-friendly section of the highway built by Greguhlicious is three blocks wide and three blocks high when entering tunnels. There are no current groups that attempt to extend the overworld highway any further, but there are players that extend it alone. As of October 2024, the highway ends at -2,200,264, being the first overworld highway to extend past 2 million blocks. The main player who made this possible, is the player [KrylonBlue](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KrylonBlue). Having been working on the highway for 3+ years, KrylonBlue is arguably the most dedicated overworld highway worker the server has ever seen. Current workers of the highway are KrylonBlue and waterman112.

Major griefs include using a TNT duping device with a Redstone flying machine that dropped duped TNT from spawn until at least -1000000 on the road. Players eventually fixed the grief on some part of the road, however, the large gap that was formed from the TNT can still be seen. Many other players tried griefing the unmaintained road by placing blocks or ice that made the road impassible without taking a detour.

## Diagonals
The Diagonal Overworld highways on 2b2t are the least maintained and they don't go that far out, few people care about expanding them and they are usually in bad condition.

### +X, +Z
As of May 2025, the southeastern highway ends at 80,700.

### +X, -Z
As of May 2025, the northeastern highway ends at 83,100.

### -X, +Z
As of July 2025, the southwestern highway ends at 101,900.

### -X, -Z
As of October 2024, the northwestern highway ends at 300,000, being the longest diagonal highway. It's unusually long length compared to the other diagonal highways is largely thanks to [waterman112](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/waterman112), who extended it by about 260,000 blocks by himself throughout 2024 as the highways sole expander. From 36,000 blocks and out, the northwestern highway has the highest standard out of all of the diagonal highways, being several blocks wide and 3 blocks tall, with constant guard rails (except for in oceans), and at a constant Y level, to allow for easy and comfortable travel.

## Rings
In 2015, [ChadDX](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ChadDX) built three ring roads around Spawn, at 400, 800, and 1,200, which were centered around [The Spire](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Spire). Today these roads have been replaced by canals built by the [WaterWay Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/WaterWay_Union). A few more roads were built as well by some anonymous players.

## Miscellaneous
### xcc2's 43z Highway
One of the oldest highways in the [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn) region. It was started by [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2) in 2011 and maintained until the [Second Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Second_Incursion) in 2013. It was well known for the netherrack pillars alongside the highway that provided light. Although some of the highway still exists to this day, it serves little to no purpose as the +x and -x highways are right next to it.
### berkbrein and b4uit's -1m X Highway
Created by [berkbrein](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/berkbrein) and [b4uit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/b4uit). Started around -1,000,000 on the X axis, and intended to expand all the way to -1,000,000 on the Z axis. Stretches about ~100,000 blocks.

### Melon Road
The **Melon Road**, also called the **Melon Highway**, was a small path that ran along the -X axis for roughly 12,500 blocks. The highway was unique in that it was made entirely out of [melon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Melons) stalks planted on a 2x2 path of farmland, with dirt blocks on either side for melons to grow on. It started roughly at X: -47 Y: 72 Z: -2,628 and exited off the [-Z Axis Highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/-Z_Axis_Highway).

Originally, it encircled spawn in a square loop about 2000 blocks from 0,0, and was constructed in late 2015 and early 2016 by the [Melon Disciples](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Melon_Disciples), starting at a spot next to [2k2k](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2k2k). For a long time it served as the easiest way for players at [spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/spawn) to obtain food and it saved many from starvation. However, almost immediately after the [Rusher Invasion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Rusher_War) began (and [TheCampingRusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) using a part of the melon highway east of 0,0 to obtain food), the melon highway was dismantled by [Veterans](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Veteran) in order to cut off the Rushers' food supply. Today, parts of the original melon highway are periodically replanted and removed by players.

### 1533z
**The 1533 Highway**, also known as the **Starving Road**, **1534 Highway**, or **Starved Road** is a West (-X) Highway beginning at roughly -1,800 X and 1533 Z, continuing along 1533 Z. It was expanded on from an early hut griefed in 2016 very close to spawn. It is largely unknown who started working on the highway in the spawn region, but a group called The 1533 Highway Gang and Maintenance would expand the highway out over 100,000 blocks sometime in between 2019-2020. A player named [abdee112](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/abdee112) would take the highway out to roughly 200,000 blocks largely by himself throughout spring of 2022. From around -200,000 X, a player named [CC315](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CC315) would take the highway all the way out to where it ends today as of February 2025 at X = -350,000. CC315 initially quit working on the highway due to the server updating to 1.19, meaning the crafting of smooth stone slabs became alot more tedious(Smooth stone slabs were the main block being used for the highway by CC315), aswell as rampant mob spawning.

At the original end of the highway (-50,000 X), the original highway maintenance individuals and travellers claim that a build griefed in 2016 (a small house at around -1000 X) made a small path resembling a dirt road due to it extending slightly beyond the ruins. The path would be expanded on in later years, mainly in 2018 and 2019. The 1533 Highway starts at -1,800 X (due to a grief in the earlier path) and goes one block wide before consistently maintaining a 2 block wide status. Due to a construction accident as well as unknown shifts, some large parts of the road shift to as far as 1519 Z in early portions of the road, especially between 20-30 thousand. The highway receives heavy traffic from newfags (especially in 2019/2020) and is generally unknown to the 2b2t community. Since the 1533 Highway originally started at -1,000 X and was assumed to be accidentally griefed within various spawn grief, large and small remains of the highway leading up to -1,800 are very visible. The highway crosses through multiple known and unknown Western, Southern and Northern Highways, including the [Old Spawn Road](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Old_Spawn_Road) (~-13,000), [Flower Trail](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Flower_Trail) (~-9,000), and the 32k Alpha Bridge (name from signs, at -32,000).{{Infobox Highway|title=Flower Trail|highwaycode=OR-2|lenght=12.000 blocks|dimention=Overworld|image=Flower Trail.jpg|caption=The Flower Trail|hccolor=008000|date_founded=~2017}}
### Flower Trail
A path covered in flowers stretching over 12,000 blocks in the vicinity of Spawn. Reviewed by YouTuber [BarrenDome](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BarrenDome) in 2019. It is unknown who created the trail.
#### Description
The trail is a two-block-wide grass path with a row of oak leaves on either side. Along the majority of the trail, the grass blocks are covered with dandelions and poppies. A small section of the trail has a mix of different flowers including peonies, rose bushes, sunflowers, azure bluets, orange tulips, white tulips, red tulips, and oxeye daisies. The trail does not have a specific Y coordinate, as it follows the elevation of the terrain, although there are a few tunnels through mountains.

At around 2,000 blocks from the end of the trail, the oak leaves on the side of the trail disappear. As the trail crosses an ocean, the quality of the trail drops. The path has been severely griefed; many dirt blocks are missing. As the trail crosses back onto land, the flowers disappear almost completely from the trail.

#### History
It is unknown how old the trail is or who built it. The oldest sign on the trail is from "TheCOldoNeJC" who claims to have written it in 2017, although this may be false as there are no other signs from this year. Most of the signs are from mid-2018.

YouTuber [BarrenDome](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BarrenDome) came across this trail in early 2019 while playing [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t). He decided to make a video on it. On January 20, 2019, he uploaded a video called *2b2t - Flower Trail* in which he toured the trail on a world download.

### Old Spawn Road
{{Main|Old Spawn Road}}

The **Old Spawn Road**, also known as the **Non-Axis road** or the **West Road,** is a road that does not run on any axis and stretches for ~27,000 blocks. It is one of the oldest roads on the server and is unique in the fact that it does not stay in a straight path and it twists and turns. The road, along with most other highways, access roads, and roads, was made and restored by several players. It was also one of, if not the, longest non-axis road on the server at one point. It now dwarfs in comparison to most non-axis and axis highways.

### 0 -4575
A highway started sometime in between 2019-2021. It starts very close to spawn and travels down the -X (West) axis while staying on Z = -4575. From spawn and up until -67,000, this highway has been worked on sporadically by various different travelers that have traveled down the highway, mainly throughout 2021-2024. After the -67,000 block milestone, a player known as [winechild](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/winechild) took the highway out to -100,000 throughout the second half of 2024, using various different colored blocks, mainly concrete and stained glass. In January of 2025, [waterman112](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/waterman112) would extend the highway out to -105,000 with a 6x6 tunnel dug out deep underground in the deepslate layer. As of February 2025, the highway ends at X = -106,800, with [looomerr](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/looomerr) being the most recent highway worker.

### Raised Stone Slab Spawn Roads
Created by [ChadDX](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ChadDX) from 2012-2014. They were placed at 400 block intervals in a grid pattern centering on [The Spire](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Spire), although they have fallen out of use in the present day as a result of, at first, rampant [lavacasting](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lavacast), and after October 2020, the [Water Cube](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Water_Cube).

### Circular Ring Road
A ring of obsidian around spawn with a radius of 1,024. The ring is at Y:255. Another one at Y:64 was started but got never finished. The ring was first started at y 240 but got abandoned before switching to y 255. Inside the circle used to be the Spawn area. The respawn area was later extended to 2,048 blocks around 0 0 . Created by [IronException](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IronException).

### 800 Ring Road
A ring road connecting all the highways was built by the [Overworld Highways Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Overworld_Highways_Association) between April, 5th, 2022, and April, 6th, 2022, the road passes through [NFE](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NFE_(Negative_Fourhundred_Eighthundred)) an iconic landmark on 2b2t.

# Carlll_

**Carlll_** is a builder and the leader of the defunct [Elysium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Elysium) group, as well as a co-leader of [Avalysium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Avalysium).
## History
Carlll_ joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) on March 19, 2019 after watching [Antvenom's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Antvenom) 2b2t video. After spending time in [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn) with other new players for several months, Carlll_ founded the [Elysium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Elysium) group with the base [Elysium I](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Elysium_I). While at Elysium I, Carlll_ participated in [The Book Club](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Book_Club), and helped to discover the lag exploit that made the event possible. Elysium I soon fell, and [Elysium II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Elysium_II) was also short-lived. While moving a stash from Elysium II, Carlll_ met [Noah3j](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Noah3j), leader of [Avalonia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Avalonia). After a short period at [Elysium II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Elysium_II), they co-founded [Avalysium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Avalysium) together. After drama with basemembers [Ionar](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ionar) and [DrBeardStash](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DrBeardStash), Carlll_ also aided with the relocation to the new Avalysium location. Carlll_ helped to lead Avalysium for much of its lifespan, and contributed to a variety of projects around the base, including his Mediterranean town and work on the various skyscrapers in the cityscape around base centre. Carlll_ also designed a massive volcano terraform and built the majority of it before Avalysium was griefed in April 2021.

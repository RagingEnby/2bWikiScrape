The **2b2t cards** were an annually recurring collection of cards of influential or well-known 2b2t players, created by [Coldwave](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coldwave) and [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86). Renditions of the cards were released by Sato in 2013, 2014, and 2015, with design changes, additions, and removals from year to year. They often included references to 2b2t's history and numerous inside jokes and banter directed at other players. A 6th and last set was made by [Jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jared2013) in 2016 during the [Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rusher_War).

In 2021, NFT trading cards were created by [kinorana](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/kinorana), which released on June 16, 2021.

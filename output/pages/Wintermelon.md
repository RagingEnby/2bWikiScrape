## History
### Origins
After the [Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rusher_War), Wintermelon was founded by [Toshie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Toshie) and [Vaxent](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vaxent). They had initially based at [Acacia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Acacia) (The City of Melons) but after the explosion of the Rushers, it soon became apparent that the base was no longer safe, it being so close to spawn.

Wintermelon started out as a modest tower build and an expansive underground storage area, but Toshie had even more on his mind. Soon after the fall of [Acacia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Acacia), [theloneloner](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/theloneloner) and [Fuffer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fuffer) joined [Toshie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Toshie) and [Vaxent](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vaxent). They also encountered [aaron_alvin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/aaron_alvin) on the nether highway, and ended up inviting him to the base as well. They would cautiously invite both new and old fags to Wintermelon.

[MrChoCho_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MrChoCho_) raised Wintermelon's power even further when he personally discovered the [11/11 Dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/11%2F11_Dupe). No one knows if the dupe was known by anyone else before he discovered it, but they allegedly "had it for an entire month before it went public", according to [FitMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FitMC).
### Fall
After the series of dupes that happened in the winter of 2016, a lot of the basemates got bored and became inactive. [Toshie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Toshie) continued keeping Wintermelon alive but, just like many bases on 2b2t, the coords were leaked by DeadlyDarkDragon due to sheer boredom. The players at Wintermelon were given warning of the base's impending grief by fellow basemate [jddinger](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jddinger), who was told by his friend and [4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4th_Reich) member [Sun_Wukon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sun_Wukon) that the 4th Reich was coming. The place was eventually griefed, following a battle that took place with over 16 players.{{Template:Citation needed}} This was the last organized event that the Reich took part in before most members joined the [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Masons) that month. Afterward, the group went on to establish another base together, [Summermelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Summermelon).

**Ragnarok**, also known as **Ragnarok I**, was a base built by [0xymoron](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0xymoron), [Ace_Of_SpADeZ](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ace_Of_SpADeZ), and others. It was home to one of the largest museums on 2b2t at the time until its griefing by [The 4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_4th_Reich).

## History
The base was started on September 10th, 2016 by [0xymoron](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0xymoron) and [Ace_Of_SpADeZ](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ace_Of_SpADeZ). It began as a small wheat farm but as the two continued to build the base they invited more players.

The base eventually began to be personalized by the individuals who lived there and eventually, 0xymoron came up with the idea to create a museum. The museum contained several [map arts](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Map_art), regular maps of some bases, artefacts and even a dragon egg from [Imperator's Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperator%27s_Base).

[The 4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_4th_Reich) eventually showed up to grief the base and when [0xymoron](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0xymoron) returned from an [Elytra](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Elytra) flight, he found most of the base completely destroyed. The destruction of the base was shown live by the 4th Reich as they sought revenge against 0xymoron for livestreaming the destruction of their base the previous day.

During the attack, several members grabbed what they could from the museum and stashes and fled. The original group then built a [second Ragnarok](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ragnarok_2) with what they had from the original base.

## Architecture
Ragnarok had several personalized structures such as a mushroom cloud, floating mushroom tower, a large wizard tower and the museum, as well as many statues. The base also featured memorials dedicated to the [Facepunch Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Facepunch_Republic) and [Plugin Town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Plugin_Town).

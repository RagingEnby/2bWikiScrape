}}**Adolf_Hitller's Private Army** was a meme group dedicated to a wide variety of projects.

## History
### Early Projects
The group was founded when [Adolf_Hitller](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitller) died back to [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn) on his account that was at [Fartropolis](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fartropolis), over 10 million blocks out. The group was originally a PvP group, but the members (at this point largely Adolf and [0Neb](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0Neb)), quickly grew tired of this. The next focus was a massive dig at -5000, 5000 in the [Overworld](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Overworld). The project attracted the attention of many players due to their constant discussion of activities in global chat, which initially helped to speed up the project, although as the digsite became too widely known, however, it fizzled out.

### Nether Border
In the fall of 2020, a [Boatfly](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Boatfly) bypass became publicly available. As a result, Adolf attempted to fly to the [Nether World Border](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/World_Border#Nether). When he did not reach it, him and 0Neb began to extend the X+ [Highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway) to the Nether World Border. The account used to dig had to be killed back to its spawnpoint to resupply, so progress was slow. The group rejected [Hare_Hare_Yukai](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hare_Hare_Yukai) from joining in their dig project, and had also been in communication with the [X+ Nether Border Diggers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/X%2B_Nether_Border_Diggers) and was beaten by both of them in March of 2021. Following this, the group went inactive on 2b2t.

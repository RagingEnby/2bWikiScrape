**Project Obsidian Sky** was a Spawn project spearheaded by [Dielo_Tai](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dielo_Tai). It was the first in a series of projects run by a variety of players which aimed to cover [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn) with an obsidian roof.

## History
On August 17th 2017, [Dielo_Tai](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dielo_Tai) started Project Obsidian Sky. With the help of a variety of players including [NoHaxJust2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NoHaxJust2b2t), [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013), [Nekramite](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nekramite), and [_Courier6_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_Courier6_), a large portion of Spawn was covered, amidst efforts to stop them, mainly from the [Peacekeepers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Peacekeepers). Dielo_Tai livestreamed the project on YouTube.

The project was halted in late September when the 2b2t admin disabled [Elytras](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Elytra). The project was partly expanded in 2019 around the time of the construction of the first Spawnmason sky logo. The project lay the foundation for later obsidian plateaus over Spawn, such as the Infinityâ€™s Incursion [Project Obsidian Sky (2020)](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Project_Obsidian_Sky_(2020)) - which had the same name as this project -, [Linked Horizon Sky](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Linked_Horizon_Sky) (2021) and [Project Dead](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Project_Dead) (2022)..

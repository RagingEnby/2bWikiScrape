# James_Rustles

**James_Rustles** is a 2b2t [oldfag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/oldfag) and blogger who served as a [Constantiam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Constantiam) admin and owner until 2025.

## History
In 2013, James Rustles started [a blog](http://www.jamesrustles.com/) about 2b2t, which since August of 2015 is hosted on his own website. It later grew to hold a lot of information about 2b2t's history using both primary and secondary sources. The blog also had "guest posts" written by other players (like [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86)) to talk about history or current events on the server.

James began posting on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JamesRustles) in late 2014, where he mostly posted clips of 2b2t and shitposts. As of May 2021, it has 2.82k subscribers, and is now also host to podcasts and historical videos, including documentaries on some of 2b2t's most famous bases like [Fenrir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2m7vJ-Eb67c&t=125s) and [Imp's Base](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUj5hcj1n0k&t=270s), as well as interviews with players such as [fastvincent1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fastvincent1) and [YellowstoneJoe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YellowstoneJoe).

James Rustles himself has been to many places on the server. He has also based at many places, Including [Asgard II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Asgard_II), [Aureus City](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Aureus_City), [Gape Group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Gape_Group) and [Fenrir](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fenrir) to name a few.

In mid-March 2016, James created the earliest known interactive map of the 2b2t world. This map can be used to see 2016's [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn) in both an isometric and top-down view, and is hosted on his website.

James quit 2b2t in early June of 2016 due to him losing interest in the server (this decision wasn't helped by the arrival of [TheCampingRusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Quarantine:TheCampingRusher)). He left the blog online and is accepting any guests posts at http://www.jamesrustles.com/

After quitting 2b2t, he played on and was the primary admin of [Constantiam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Constantiam), a similar anarchy server, until 2025 where he sold the server. One of the Constantiam community's biggest memes was that PhantomCaptain, the server's admin, was actually James Rustles; This "theory" was eventually proven beyond a shadow of a doubt but was betrayed many times by James' behavior and indirect comments.

James returned to 2b2t for a short period in 2022 when [Donfuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer) rebuilt Aureus City. He played here for several weeks before the base was once again self-griefed, wherein he left the server entirely.

## Trivia

**Bedrock City** is a building group & series of bases founded by the player usuriousberry39 on 2builders2tools. It is most notable for its [extensive digital documentation](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC75FUdnPSn-2KWTO55zvISw) by usuriousberry39 and its strict guidelines for both membership and builds. The building guidelines are a founding part of the City with only Bedrock Edition injections being allowed.

Bedrock City is known for the quote by UsuriousBerry39: "Bedrock City Supports All Groups". This is because Berry prefers to remain neutral on the server, wanting to enjoy the game in his own way, and understanding that everyone enjoys the game differently. This is an ideal that most members of Bedrock City hold. Despite some drama, usuriousberry39 has been able to maintain a friendly relationship with most groups because of these convictions.

## History
Upon logging into 2b2t in September of 2022, usuriousberry39 went on to found [Bedrock Base 1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bedrock_Base_1) with [Knight2077](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Knight2077) and a few others in a jungle biome about 420k blocks from spawn. It was at this base that Berry first established his ideas for what Bedrock City would eventually become, and also held his first stash on the server, which was found by fellow Bedrock City member: [_Bazzerk_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_Bazzerk_). Being invited to this base and building there became a right of passage for every member of Bedrock City until it was griefed by unknown players in June of 2025.

### Bedrock City
Bedrock City was founded by usuriousberry39 in November of 2022. Usuriousberry39 who had joined 2b2t in the months prior, met the player [DuctTapeMessiah](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DuctTapeMessiah) through the 2b2t reddit. DuctTapeMessiah invited him to the base [Rainbow Road](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rainbow_Road) and the group [The Wayfarers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Wayfarers) was formed amongst the members following Usuriousberry39's arrival. Following a short stint at the base, Usuriousberry39 left to found what would become the first iteration of Bedrock City.

Bedrock City was established with the intention for all members to be "Bedrock Crafters", or players who own/develop on Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. Following this unique mentality it was decided that all of the base's builds were to be taken from building competitions hosted on Usuriousberry39's bedrock server, various other server's building competitions, and master builder private worlds and recreated on 2b2t through the use of schematics and [baritone](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/baritone), this is why many commonly refer to Bedrock City builds as “injections”. Bedrock City was found in June of 2023 after DuctTapeMessiah used a screenshot taken from usuriousberry39's screenshare that contained a visual waypoint of Bedrock City. DuctTapeMessiah took the screenshot and asked members of Outlast to help him triangulate the coordinates. Shortly after, [Outlast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Outlast) and [The Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys) arrived to grief the first Bedrock City [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNGjHd_Y-74](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNGjHd_Y-74).

### Bedrock City 2
Following the downfall of the first Bedrock City, Bedrock City 2 was established in June 2023.

This base is considered more significant than either its predecessor, Bedrock City, or successor, Bedrock City 3, largely due to its extensive use of redstone and impressive longevity. It featured a massive wool farm, a highly efficient Raid Farm, a large-scale iron farm, and several other redstone-powered builds. These farms played a crucial role in supplying materials for the many ambitious projects Bedrock City was working on at the time.

Bedrock City 2 was found by [Outlast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Outlast), and rather than grief the members took up residence at the base. However, this was short lived as their builds did not following the strict guidelines and as such usuriousberry39 decided to leak the coordinates publicly. Shortly after the leak, usuriousberry39's old basemate, DuctTapeMessiah, showed up to grief the second Bedrock City.

### Bedrock City 3
After the destruction of Bedrock City 2, usuriousberry39 wanted to ensure the base's security. In June 2024, he established Bedrock City 3 over 17 million blocks out from Spawn, taking many precautions to ensure the safety of the base. Coordinates were given to all members of the group, and they all made their way to the location.

Shortly after the base was founded, members of [Outlast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Outlast) showed up, not to grief, but to join in on the builds. Much like with the original Bedrock City, a leaked screenshot featuring a waypoint of Bedrock City 3 was used by [Se7en](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Se7en) to triangulate the coordinates and find the base.

In January of 2025, DuctTapeMessiah using the triangulated coordinates, arrived at Bedrock City 3 and griefed the base. After this, DuctTapeMessiah and usuriousberry39 had a back and forth with videos and discord posts trolling each other.

### Bedrock City 4
After the destruction of BC3, Berry worked with [_Bazzerk_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_Bazzerk_) to establish Bedrock City 4. This was also when Berry made [3XCLUSIVEDRAGON](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/3XCLUSIVEDRAGON) & [Max1mumChr1s](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Max1mumChr1s) official members of Bedrock City.

## Organization
There is a very loose hierarchy within Bedrock City. The Group itself is simply a group of friends who want to build and have fun together. Main group decisions are done by Berry, including what events are held, and where bases will be.

All members are free to do as they wish, so long as they do not cause backlash for Bedrock City. This allows for Bedrock City to be involved in many different events and activities across the server.

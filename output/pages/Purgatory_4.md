Also known as **Mesa Purgatory**, **Purgatory 4** was a tempbase built by [Builder's Haven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Builders_Haven). It was founded after [Keir](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Keir) (also known as [Skerge](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Skerge)) and [Bloctagon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bloctagon) wanted to find a new spot for a temp base. It was a few thousand blocks away from the ruins of [Purgatory II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Purgatory_2), so it wasn't a terrible distance to travel. The notable builds there were the quarry, Bloctagon's futuristic tower, [HawkedOnFonix](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HawkedOnFonix)'s house, along with [1Charlie3](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/1Charlie3) and [BigBat](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BigBat)'s desert casino (unfinished). Many builds used a quartz, blue and green stained glass colour palette due to the abundance of those blocks in the dupe stashes.

Keir leaked the coordinates to Xdolf, who came on an alt (TheBronyOf2b2t), and griefed the base. There was also a battle between Xdolf and members of the base.

After the grief, the members of Builder's Haven moved on to build [Exposition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Exposition).Notable Builds at Purgatory 4

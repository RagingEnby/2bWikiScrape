# ''2b2t Chronicles''

***2b2t Chronicles*** is a fictional [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) web series on YouTube and is a project run by many players. The goal is to create a fictional story series set on 2b2t for everyone to enjoy. It uses the popular style of videos often referred to as "Machinima", which has seen usage by other YouTubers to portray real events in the past (such as [Trump_17](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Trump_17) and [fastvincent1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fastvincent1)). However, *2b2t Chronicles* is the first time this style of video was used to tell fictional stories, and the current understanding is that *2b2t Chronicles* is the first time any 2b2t-centric fictional stories have been told on this scale.

## History
The original concept of the Chronicles originates back to January 2020, when a group of people came together to create a "story show" set on 2b2t. The original story consisted of a fictional player in 2011 making his way to NFE, meeting xcc2, only to have popbob show up and an argument begins. The name of this project was the "2b2t Movie Society", however, it slowly fell into inactivity, and it seemed doomed to be one of many abandoned 2b2t ideas.

However, on March 31, 2020, [VillagerFilms](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/VillagerFilms) came to [Trump_17](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Trump_17), discussing the idea of a potential 2b2t "comedy story". Trump_17 told Villager about the movie society, and invited Villager to the Discord server. The next day, on April 1, 2020, Villager started renovating everything, and fixing the server up, bringing it back to life. The ideas slowly came together to form the modern idea of the Chronicles. Production of the series itself began a few days later. Episodes 1 and 2 were both finished in April, and within a few days. However, Episodes 3 to 5 took weeks to produce for a variety of reasons. Episodes 6 to 8 were finished far quicker due to the usage of a mod called Blockbuster by McHorse. For most of the series, visual editing was done by Villager first, then the visual video was transferred to Trump_17, who did the audio due to him being praised for having very good music choice and audio work on his personal channel.

On June 10, 2020, multiple 2b2t YouTubers uploaded a video that was a teaser for the *2b2t Chronicles*, them being [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86), [VillagerFilms](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/VillagerFilms), [Trump_17](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Trump_17), [DigMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Digandbuilder) (at the end of his "the entire history of 2b2t, I guess", as well as being mentioned by [fastvincent1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fastvincent1)'s community tab. Then, on July 25, 2020, a full trailer was released on the *2b2t Chronicles* channel, showing actual clips from the series. On August 1, the first episode was released, with mixed reception. Episodes 2 to 4 were released over the next 3 weeks. Then, there was a 2-month mid-season break before Episodes continued regularly from Episodes 5-8 on October 31st. The first season ended on November 21, 2020, which makes Season 1 last from August to November 2020, with a promise of a season 2 in a few months.

There was also an April Fools' episode containing a fictionalized retelling of the famous flame war between popbob and jared2013 that took place on December 26, 2015.

On July 1, 2021, a trailer was released for Season 2. Season 2 officially began on July 31, with the premiere episode "The Brawl of Wrath", to mostly positive reception. Season 2 ended on October 9, with a promise of a season 3.

In the time between Season 2, many members of the team, including some directors, began losing interest in the project, simply due to real life things. By the time Season 3 began filming in Spring 2022, there were only two people actively working on the project (not counting actors, who would come and go at random) - Emperor_Walrus and [VillagerFilms](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/VillagerFilms), who did most of the filming, editing, composing, and sound design all by themselves for the 3rd season.

On August 6th, 2022, Season 3 began it's first half, which ran with four episodes until October 30th, with a promise of a conclusion to the series to come in the form of Season 3 Part 2.

On December 15th, 2022, an update video was posted that announced not only their next project, an original animated series unrelated to 2b2t, but more importantly, how Season 3 Part 2 would be released. It stated that Season 3 Part 2 would be released all in one weekend as a big finale event, with Friday being the release of Season 3 Episode 5, Saturday being the release of Season 3 Episode 6, and Sunday being the release of a separate movie to conclude the series, titled 2b2t Chronicles: End of the Road. When this event will take place is currently known beyond that it will take place on a weekend.

## Plot concept
The plot centers around a total of five fictional players that go by the username Main02, Sheriff_Motch, Rossi, Astr0 and InsaneBeach. All five players have unique personalities that dictate their actions on the server. Main meets Sheriff while escaping the spawn region during the 2nd Incursion (fall 2013), and the two become close friends, despite their dichotomy of desires (Main being an anti-griefing builder and Sheriff being a griefer.) As they go on a variety of adventures, they meet many real players, that are supposedly portrayed how they actually were at the time. Over time, as they get further from spawn, they meet more and more players, fictional and non-fictional, some who become enemies, some who become friends. Eventually, Sheriff and Main naturally grow apart due to their differences, which gradually changes them as characters.

## Characters
*Main02: Main02 is a main character, alongside Sheriff. He is a builder who is very against griefing and he loves the "block game history". He is what would be called a "larper" in modern 2b2t.
*Sheriff_Motch: Sheriff_Motch is a player who enjoys griefing, and struggles finding the fun in any form of building, and often struggles with building itself. His signature weapon is a bow, entrusted to him by [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2) at [NFE](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NFE_(Negative_Fourhundred_Eighthundred)) before Sheriff and Main departed into the nether.
*Rossi: Rossi is more experienced player who always fixes things, and always has to put up with Main and Sheriff's occasional bickering and arguments. He acts like a babysitter of sorts to Sheriff and Main, but he has a bit of a backstory of his own, and he used to be a much different person. Met Sheriff and Main after they griefed his base, Lost Hopes.
*Astr0: Astr0 is a player in a pair of newfags Main, Sheriff and Rossi met in Episode 6. He is a massive nerd, and knows a lot about redstone machinery. InsaneBeach's lack of knowledge about Minecraft as a whole constantly irritates him.
*InsaneBeach: Beach is the second player in a pair of newfags Main, Sheriff and Rossi met in Episode 6. He acts like a stereotypical 80s surfer and knows very little about Minecraft, due to him only installing it three hours ago at the time they met Main, Sheriff and Rossi. He keeps remarking about "sharpness pages", which is a result of his misunderstanding of the item-enchanting mechanic in Minecraft.
*TallyX: Tally is a [rusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/rusher) who joins the server as its no-rules nature appeals to his grumpy and somewhat rude demeanor. He's also knowledgeable on hacked clients and Minecraft multiplayer and how it works.
*Ellie_Aloha is also a rusher, who played on Rusher's server beforehand before coming to 2b2t. Despite the toxicity on 2b2t, she carries a certain innocence and naivety, and cares a lot for others; but most of all, she loves stories and therefore, is attracted to 2b2t because of its vast history.

* Most of the sets are actual structures on 2b2t; barring most of the bases built from scratch by the main characters.
* A plot spanning 3 seasons was planned from the start.
* Character InsaneBeach takes inspiration from "Fart_Garfunkel" from falconer02's classic Minecraft animation series "The N00b Adventures"
* In Episode 2, Uzify is killed by a lone arrow shot by Sheriff_Motch after xcc2 missed his shot. This is an altered version of a true story, where xcc2 kills Uzify with a lone arrow during his attempted grief.
*In Season 2 Episode 1, jared2013 makes an appearance. He is one of the few characters with custom text-scrolling noises, and his sound specifically is an edited version of the real jared's laughter.
*The fight scene that takes place in Season 2 Episode 1 has music choice and visuals that reference the classic Newgrounds series "Super Mario Bros. Z" by Mark Haynes. On top of this, the music choice and choreography in the end fight scene in Season 2 Episode 9 also reference "Super Mario Bros. Z"

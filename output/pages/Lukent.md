He joined the [Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperials) in October 2021, where he quickly achieved a high rank in the group, before leaving following internal drama, alongside [Toska](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Toska), [ACABMichael](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ACABMichael), and [HenkieMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HenkieMC). Together, they founded their own group, called [The Collective](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Collective). Lukent became a leader in the group.

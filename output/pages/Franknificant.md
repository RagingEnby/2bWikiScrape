**Franknificant** is a [newfag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/newfag) builder mostly known for designing and building builds based on fictional and [real-life structures](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/List_of_builds_based_on_real_life_locations). Most of his builds are available on [The Archive](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Archive_(server)). Frank has also been interviewed by [Lunch_Katsu](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lunch_Katsu) about his experiences on the server.

## History
Franknificant joined in May 2020 but remained largely inactive until September 2020. He has designed and built multiple structures on 2b, most of which were used for public spawn events like [Fight Club](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fight_Club), Nomad Games and [Pitfight](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pitfight). Four of these structures together formed the 'Four Spawn Churches Project', a series of churches all on opposite coordinates within the spawn region.  Frank developed a building style where he would integrate an 'obsidian core' to the building, meaning that behind each wallm ceiling and floor a hidden obsidian skeleton would be integrated. This made the builds harder to grief while also allowing for variation in its block palette.

Early 2021 Frank was invited by [BachiBachBach](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BachiBachBach) to take a leadership position in the new [Infinity Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinity_Incursion) building division. Due to backlash after raiding a Guardsmen Base in the II building division he left the group after the first spawnbase: George Harbor.

After participating in the grief of a [SpawnMason](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons) lodge and base called Chunk Haven with [Team Rocket](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Rocket), [Todarac](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Todarac) used  the [Nocom exploit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nocom) to find one of Franks personal abandoned stashes.

In September 2021 Frank and Forceken started [The2b2tTimes](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Times), a weekly newspaper printed as a mapart and spread all over the server. They covered different topics, such as exploits, the potential of the server updating, the drama surrounding [Jakethasnake52](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jakethasnake52) and [BachiBachBach](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BachiBachBach) and their behavior around minors and the 'unwritten rules' of the server leading to multiple bans.

In April 2022 Frank constructed a map id wall containing over 99% of all map ids in the game, as of version 1.12.2.

In June 2022 Franks Duomo Cathedral was used for a Wedding Event, as covered by [Fit.](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit)

In October 2022 Franknificant participated in the grief of Sky Masons.

Starting in late 2022 Frank spearheaded [The 2b2t Museum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_2b2t_Museum), an archiving and collecting project.

**The Autumn Drain** was a base at the location of the late-2016 base [The Drain](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Drain), which first aimed to repair the base from its ruins, though eventually expanded to create a much larger base than The Drain was. Initiated by Vietnamese YouTuber [0Channy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0Channy) on October 22, 2020, many others joined the project, until the base was made public and griefed on December 18, 2020.

## History
In October 2020, Vietnamese YouTuber 0Channy and his friend [Lunch_Katsu](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lunch_Katsu) began a project whose aim was to repair the entirety of the original Drain. Initially working alone, they invited a few friends over. The base was found on November 26 by active player and YouTuber [digandbuilder](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/digandbuilder), who contacted [Terbin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Terbin), who in turn told the original builders [Offtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Offtopia) and [willyroof](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/willyroof) about the rebuild. Many players were invited, and the base was vastly expanded beyond its original size, becoming the largest reconstruction project of a griefed base in 2b2t history. The [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons) held a weekly lodge at the base, making some of their own additions during their stays. After [BarrenDome](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BarrenDome) was invited to the base, [Armorsmith](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith) began to grief and spam the coordinates to the base, on December 18, 2020. After fighting Armorsmith and his followers, the rest of the Drain Gang destroyed the rest of the base in a self-grief.

### Drain Gang
Members of the SpawnMasons, [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen), [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate), [Infinity Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinity_Incursion), [Armorsmith's Followers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith%27s_Followers), [Acadia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Acadia), and [Monolith](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Monolith) were present at the base, contributing to its massive size. These players coalesced into a group called the Drain Gang. It represented the builders of the Autumn Drain trusted enough to be added to its private discord server. Drain Gang later built a short-lived project called 'The Fleet', which built a fleet of ships at a different location. Drain Gang members participated in a number of projects afterwards, such as the [Rat House](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rat_House), before going inactive, or participating in [Linked Horizon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Linked_Horizon) or [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood).

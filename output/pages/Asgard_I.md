}}**Asgard I,** originally named **Asgard,** was a Valkyrian base originally planned by [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86) in anticipation of the 1.7 Minecraft update sometime in October 2013. The base was never completed and was later abandoned due to [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob)'s discovery of the base. It is the predecessor of [Asgard II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Asgard_II) and was retroactively named Asgard I.

## History
Asgard I was initially planned to be built on a mountain that was deemed as "the best terrain ever found on 2b2t" by [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86). [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86) later invited [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2), [Offtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Offtopia), and [passie05](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/passie05) to help construct the base and had high hopes for the build. However, the base did not come to be as popbob had managed to find the coordinates by using the [Thunderhack exploit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Thunderhack_exploit). 2 weeks before he arrived he claimed he was exploring Nether coordinates that which were Asgard's but with the opposite Z coordinate. Zxcwbz1 was initially blamed for leaking the base coordinates to [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob).

This would lead to the group abandoning the base and [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86) would quit for several months afterwards. The base seemed to be nearly intact in 2015, as shown by screenshots by the player [Mrx](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mrx).

## History
### 2023
#### Southern Canal Association
Max1mumChr1s joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) on December 6th, 2022. He wandered [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn) and constructed several small short-term bases before seeing a video by [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) about the [Southern Canal's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Southern_Canal) expansion by the [Southern Canal Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Southern_Canal_Association). He traveled to the canal and met [Joppari19](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joppari19) there, which resulted in Max1mumChr1s joining SCA. He helped to extend the canal from 520k to 530k, at which point it was paved over by [ChiefBeefLoko](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ChiefBeefLoko) and [raptr_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/raptr_). This resulted in Max1mumChr1s taking a break from 2b2t, and temporarily moving to [Constantiam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Constantiam), where he became affiliated with [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) and [Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperials), which then resulted in his return to 2b2t.

#### WaterWay Union
Also accompanying the canal pave-over was drama directed at one of SCA's leaders, [xForgew](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xForgew), which resulted in most of the group's members moving to the [WaterWay Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/WaterWay_Union), of which, Max1mumChr1s was one of the earliest members. While with the group, he co-constructed the 550k monument with [Phosph0lipid](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Phosph0lipid) (called "The Halo") and worked to extend the canal. He also helped to judge the [RatRace](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/WaterWayUnion#RatRace), one of the groups early events, alongside [ThebesAndSound](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ThebesAndSound), [Godroster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Godroster), and [_xque](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_xque). He later departed from the WWU after drama surrounding the grief of Don Maximus, but he still maintains friendships with many of its members and leaders.

#### DonFuer
Upon his return to 2b2t after the Southern Canal's pave-over, Max1mumChr1s mainly focused on Donfuer, and built at several of the group's SpawnFuer bases. After changes within Donfuer occurred that contributed to base security in March 2023, he founded the base "GlenLivet" (which was later re-named to [Don Maximus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Don_Maximus)), alongside [Traveeseemo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Traveeseemo) and [Tanzinator](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tanzinator). He managed the base and was active there over its several-month lifespan. Don Maximus became DonFuer's largest mid-rank base built up to that point. Max1mumChr1s has also built at a variety of other DonFuer bases, such as [SteamFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SteamFuer) (where he built his large Unga Bunga Statue), and [FutureFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FutureFuer) where he built many of the smaller builds around the base like the Future-Village and the Large Drain.

#### GrayBeard Geezers
During his time in Donfuer, Max1mumChr1s became close with a fellow builder named [MuskWizard](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MuskWizard). Through this friendship, he was invited to the GrayBeard Geezers, a group on the server that is primarily made up of members of the community that are above the age of 30. After joining, he was invited to the base [Geezertown 5](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Geezertown_5), and began construction of a floating island house at the base. He also signed his name to the base's group Mapart for GT5. Before he was able to complete his house, the base was griefed by [Outlast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Outlast).

Max1mumChr1s was one of the first members of the Geezers to arrive at [Geezer Town 6](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Geezer_Town_6). He quickly constructed 2 sky builds at the base right in front of the signboard. He was one of the most active builders at GT6, constructing many builds around the base, and helped to construct a large canal running down the center of the base. Max1mumChr1s logged on right after the base was griefed while members of the base were still fighting off the griefers, and helped to salvage many materials and valuables that survived the grief.

Max1mumChr1s became close with many prominent members of the community through this. He was also invited to [EveryoneBase](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/EveryoneBase), which was a large community base founded by [Joey Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut).

#### Drama
After the griefing of Don Maximus, Max1mumChr1s was involved in drama involving several other former members of Donfuer. At the time of the grief, it was unknown who leaked the coordinates to Don Maximus, but Max1mumChr1s believed it was [Ko8efanboy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ko8efanboy). Because of the drama between Max1mumChr1s and Ko8e, along with a couple other former members of Donfuer, Max1mumChr1s leaked the coordinates to Ko8e's PvP stash, that was shared with several other well known PvPers. This resulted in him being demoted in Donfuer and being removed from WaterWay Union. Max1mumChr1s eventually earned his rank back in Donfuer, and reconciled with some in WaterWay Union who lost trust in him.

### 2024
#### Donfuer
In early 2024, Max1mumChr1s was invited to build at both versions of [Gysfuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer), the Donfuer Spawn base founded by [Warske](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Warske). He built multiple small builds at both of these bases before they were griefed.

In March of 2024, Max1mumChr1s joined many other members of Donfuer and VEA in building at the Spawn base: [Red Castle](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer). Max1mumChr1s was one of the first members of Donfuer to arrive at the base, and he helped to build much of the central area of the base. He also worked with a couple other lower ranked members of Donfuer to carve out a small canal at the base to match the [Southern Canal](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Southern_Canal). Max1mumChr1s continued to be one of the most active members of the base until it was griefed on May 4th by [Outlast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Outlast) and [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood).

In early July, 2024, [Donfuer 28](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer_28) was made public after the coordinates to the base were leaked to Outlast. Max1mumChr1s was one of the most active members of this base, helping to construct several of the islands and other builds around the base. His main project at the base was the construction of the Mapart Gallery Island. He also built a replica of the Battle Pyramid from Pokemon: Battle Frontier, and he built the player-made ocean on the Dock Island at the base.

When the base was found to be compromised, Max1mumChr1s was one of the members who helped to gather all the materials at the base, so they could be transported away to a safe location. He helped in self-griefing the base alongside many other members of the base.

At the end of 2023. Max1mumChr1s founded [The Hidden Vale](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Hidden_Vale) in 1.19 chunks as a place for friends of his from Constantiam to play on 2b2t. This base was inspired by [The Boedecken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Boedecken), and was built almost completely underground. He was active at this base until it was eventually found by [Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperials) and leaked to [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium), where it was then self-griefed by members of the base.

#### VEA
In early 2024 Max1mumChr1s became heavily involved in VEA projects. He assisted in helping to keep the group active, and built at several smaller VEA bases. Due to his activity in the group, he was promoted to 'Ass Elite' rank in the group quickly.

Max1mumChr1s helped to run some of the events that the group runs weekly, alongside other leaders and members in VEA.

In April 2024, Max1mumChr1s was invited to [Chromatown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chromatown) by [Vapepens](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vapepens). He built several smaller builds around the base, as well as a large Tower in the 'Black Area' of the base. He was active at the base until it was griefed by [The Enclave](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Enclave) in November 2024.

#### United Builders
In late 2024, Max1mumChr1s was contacted by his long-time friend Traveeseemo. He mentioned to him that a few of their friends were going to start a new group on the server called The [United Builders](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/United_Builders). Max1mumChr1s joined and is still active in the group building at many of their bases.

#### Bedrock City
Max1mumChr1s became involved with Bedrock City at the end of 2024 through his work in UB. He participated in multiple event bases including a Bedrock City Book Event at the End World Border.

#### End of 2024
Near the end of 2024, Max1mumChr1s became close friends with [Sage_Mathias](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sage_Mathias) & [SmackAttack86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SmackAttack86). He built at a couple small spawn bases with them, and continues to maintain that friendship.

At the end of 2024, Max1mumChr1s decided to not be involved in any larger groups, deciding to keep to himself and his friends.

### 2025
#### Graybeard Geezers
In early January 2025, Max1mumChr1s was invited to Geezer Town 16 by [clink_clank](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/clink_clank). He built a large underground area at the base as well as several sky islands with a large blackstone sphere.
Max1mumChr1s was also invited to GeezerTown 17 where he spent time building in the 'Bedrock City' area of the base with [_Bazzerk_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_Bazzerk_) & [usuriousberry39](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/usuriousberry39).

Max1mumChr1s founded the [Cliffs of Geezer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cliffs_of_Geezer) in January 2025 as a personal base with his friends from the GBG. It lasted until June 2025 when it was found by [WindRider13](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/WindRider13) and griefed.

#### Bedrock City
In January of 2025, Max1mumChr1s; alongside [3XCLUSIVEDRAGON](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/3XCLUSIVEDRAGON), was made an official member of Bedrock City. He remains an active member of the group, hanging out with them and building at various bases and events.

In April 2025, Max1mumChr1s was one of the members of Bedrock City that was invited to [Adamantium II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen), which was renamed to 'Farout', after the base was revived by members of [Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column) & Emperium. He built a Watchtower as well as several smaller builds there.

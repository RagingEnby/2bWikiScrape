}}The ** Highway Workers Union** or **HWU** is a [group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/group) dedicated to constructing and repairing infrastructural buildings (i.e. [nether highways](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/nether_highways)), all whilst making them easier to navigate and traverse. The [group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/group) is currently the most active [nether highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/highway) [groups](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/groups) on 2b2t after the fall of the [Independent Interstate Society](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Independent_Interstate_Society_(IIS)).
{{Highways}}

Usually, [highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/highway) paving was done by hand or by using scuffed scaffold modules back in the days when [Independent Interstate Society (IIS)](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Independent_Interstate_Society) made every [highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/highway) to 50k [nether](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/nether) (project completed on January 30, 2020). The HWU started to build with baritone as it was a huge step towards automation and made the whole process easier and faster.

Expanding every [highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/highway) to 125k [nether](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/nether) (a pursued [IIS](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Independent_Interstate_Society) project and the first main project of the HWU) was a possible goal now, so the HWU began and finished it on October 21, 2020, which was something that years before seems impossible and got the HWU a large amount of attention on the server.

What helped boost productivity all over, was automation. The highways the HWU build are made using [Highway Tools](https://github.com/lambda-plugins/HighwayTools), as a [Lambda](https://github.com/lambda-client/lambda) plugin for walking, mining, and block placing. All highways are constructed with obsidian to make them as difficult to grief as possible. The group works on multiple nether highway projects but the project scope is not limited to the nether dimension.

## History
### Founding
The [group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/group) was founded on September 10, 2020, by the users [Save_G](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Save_G) and [Anni H.S](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Anni_H.S). They created the HWU because they wanted a better [highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/highway) [group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/group) that learned from the mistakes that the [IIS](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IIS) made, and came to the conclusion that it is better to have more than one [group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/group) leader. The group is led by The Workers Politburo, whose function is to decide together what will be done next and also vote the suggestions of the other highway workers, aiming to listen to every single one of them. They created a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/QrJsP6FuJB) and even a [website](https://highways2b2t.net/).

### Discord Server Nuke
On the 11th of September, 2022, nearly 2 years after the group was founded, the HWU Discord server was [nuked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTNWmUwoX20&t=59s&ab_channel=Killet), under claims of [SpawnMason](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons) affiliation, lack of purpose, and corrrupted leadership. _handyman was the catalyst for this operation, as he had Administrator at the time. Handyman employed the help of Killet, Flaw, & Nikozi to carry out the nuke. This was a major setback for HWU because roles were wiped, everyone was banned, and most documentation was stolen. All channels were downloaded prior to the nuke, by those who nuked them, but never made public. The nukers also stole the "discord.gg/highways" vanity server URL which was the primary source of new blood into the group, and had been advertised on many of the groups projects up until now.

However, The HWU did not collapse. After about a week, the server's channels, and roles were restored, and work still continues on putting everything back to normal. All bans were wiped, as it was impossible to know which members were banned during the nuke, and ones banned before. All roles were also wiped, but leadership slowly restored roles as time went on.

As of January 2025, over two years after the incident, the server's roles have been restored, and it the group is still in operation, albeit in a slightly weaker state. The discord membership is only 1/2 of what it was prior to the nuke.

## Relations
The HWU has strong ties with the [Motorway Extension Gurus (MEG)](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Motorway_Extension_Gurus). They maintain a decent (or at least, neutral) relation with as many [groups](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/groups) as possible, as their focus is solemnly to do [highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/highway) work.

## Projects
### Diagonals Highways to 125k
The project intent was to have all diagonal [highways](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/highways) safer and easier to navigate for new and old players. The way of doing it is to have an obsidian [highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/highway) all the way to 1m overworld or 125k [nether](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/nether). The highways are made of 4 obsidian flats for the main axes and 2-3 on the diagonals with rails on both sides.. Purple: Completed Obsidian Highway, Orange: Ready for Paving, Green: (3x3)/(6x4) Netherrack Tunnel]]
 workers expanding a diagonal obsidian [highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/highway).]]This project was initially created/executed by the [IIS](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IIS) but was eventually forwarded to the HWU and executed in a good team effort. The HWU was responsible for the completion of the Southeast and the Northeast [highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/highway) sections, as well as some miscellaneous paving and infrastructure corrections on some areas along these axes.

The HWU used more than *<u>**800k**</u>* obsidian to finish this project which requires a lot of resupply (in form of ender chests that can be mined for obsidian). On October 21, 2020, the HWU completed the southwest [highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/highway) (-X +Z) and by this finished the whole project after more than one month and a lot of time put into it.

### Main axis Highways to 1m
The main goal of this project is to expand the obsidian nether highways (+X, -X, +Z, -Z) to 1 million. This is the first project where automation on a new level is used. The HWU started using special custom modules in [KAMI Blue](https://kamiblue.org/) (now discontinued, replaced by [Lambda](https://github.com/lambda-client/lambda)) so that it was almost possible to build while the user was completely AFK. These modules covered the automatic mining of ender chests and precisely placing the blocks.

The modules were tested by the HWU and had not yet been released publicly in KAMI Blue. The project to extend all the straight highways to 1 million has been completed as of 09 February 2021. Further extension of the highways was planned.

### The Diamond Highway
The Nether Diamond Highway is another ring road that connects all straight highways at 50k from spawn (crossing the diagonals at 25k), but it is rotated by 45 degrees compared to the regular ring roads. Its purpose is to reduce traveling time if killing back to spawn is not an option. This reduces the distance to be traveled from one straight highway to another by about 30% (71k blocks instead of 100k blocks distance). The Diamond Highway has been completely dug and paved with obsidian by the HWU. Other diamond highways are planned as well (closer to spawn and further away)

This project started at end of December 2020 and has been finished on the 7th of February 2021

### All diagonals Highways to 1 million
The project intent was to have all diagonal [highways](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/highways) safer and easier to navigate for players that want to go very far in the nether. The way of doing it is to have an obsidian [highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/highway) all the way to 8 million overworld or 1 million [nether](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/nether). The highways are made of 4 obsidian flats for the main axes and 2-3 on the diagonals with rails on both sides.

### +X axis Highways to world border
The HWU members voted on the project on February 16, 2021, and it was completed on August 2, 2021. The goal of this project was to pave the X+ highway in the nether between 1 million and 3,75 million (30 million in the overworld) to reach the world border using highway tools (Kami Blue and Lambda). This project used 16.5 million blocks of obsidian. A very large milestone was designed at the world's border by Makers and [Offsetpanda701](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Offsetpanda701) of the [MCG](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Monument_Construction_Group). The monuments to world border milestones were built by NetherHighways, Offsetpanda701, Maker, and Sandturtle. The World Border Milestone is a large expanse with different monuments (a giant statue of Cthulhu , a nether dwarf, and other mythological animals). You can see a tour of this milestone [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMWPYsb8WKg). Another milestone with some monuments has been built at 3 million on the +X highway by [Maker](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Maker) and Offsetpanda701. You can see a tour of this milestone [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiIgGHySdFE).

### HWU spawn symbol (the spawn thing)
The idea of creating the biggest logo on 2b2t has surfaced on August 2, 2021, just after the paving of +X to the overworld worldborder project was finished. The original design was made by AnniHeartbreak and optimized by IronException. The goal of the project was to make the biggest obsidian logo in the nether and on 2b2t in general (10k x 10k logo), and thanks to the Nether Spawn Excavation project, this project became possible. The logo is built on the nether roof (dug-out area of the 5k radius) on y-level 119 (one block lower than the highways). That means that the area is 4 blocks high which makes it easier to travel with elytra in those areas. Nothing was built within the 1k radius which II had bombed out during their project "Secret void" to not create big obsidian platforms that could be used to make a spawn escape much easier. The project officially started on September 11, 2021.

This was an enormous project: ***28,168,285 obsidian*** were placed, the equivalent of 2037 echest shulkers or 38 dubs of echest shulkers (more obsidian than [the Masonic Eclipse symbol](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Masonic_Eclipse), which has 28,154,762 blocks). The logo was built on y-level 119, so two layers of netherrack (56,336,570 blocks) needed to be cleared, which required 340 pickaxe shulkers, or 6.3 dubs.

Different parts of the logo were outlined, some workers dug the netherrack using HighwayTools while others paved the areas with HighwayTools or Baritone. For grinding obsidian from ender chests, workers used AutoObsidian module or the integrated function of grinding obsidian in HighwayTools. Resupply of materials happened through assigned workers that put ender chests, pickaxes, gaps, and thorns armors in dungeon chests in the overworld.

The project's workers, however, had encountered some difficulties: hostile players attempting to kill them and the spawn of ghasts (which can spawn due to the height at which the project was built, so thorns armors were needed to kill them while afk digging/paving). Journeymap mod was used to see the outlines of sections, keep track of progression and waypoints for each section. The project was completed at 9:45 AM UTC on March 9, 2022 (after almost six months of work). A WDL of the 5k nether spawn (10240 x 10240), which was made by baka_833 can be found [here](https://mega.nz/folder/zxkRXQxQ#KSdeswGiqyggBFV2HlQ6tA).

### Widening of the Diagonal Highways
This project has been chosen by the community as well as the workers to improve traveling on diagonal highways, since the travel meta in 2022 (different elytrafly exploits as well as EntitySpeed didn't require the railing anymore.

Over the course of 217 days, 8 million netherrack and 8 million obsidian was mined, and over 8 million obsidian was placed. This consisted of more than 5600 hours of digging time.

**NamoVFX** (aka **Namo**) is a newfag builder on 2b2t and was a high-ranking member of [Donfuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer). He also built at [DonFuer 25](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_25) and [Don Maximus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Don_Maximus).

## History
### Early History
Namo joined 2b2t on March 4th, 2022. Namo met [Hockeyl8](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hockeyl8), who introduced him [BryceDey](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BryceDey), who geared him in [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn). He traveled out of spawn and started his first base, which he became bored of and abandoned several days later. He returned to Spawn, and began base hunting following advice to do so from BryceDey. He found his first stash soon thereafter, although lost it to an accidental leak several weeks later. His next find was [FastVincent's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FastVincent) base, [Hamlet](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hamlet). He split the stash with [Patrionyt](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Patrionyt), who leaked Hamlet to Hockeyl8. Patrionyt and Hockeyl8 griefed the base soon thereafter. Namo briefly built with [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood), where he built at a [Moonshriner](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Ranks) base led by [D_loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_loaded), who invited him to [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer).

### Donfuer
On May 16th, 2022, NamoVFX joined Donfuer. He built at several Donfuer bases throughout May and June, namely: [Don Aken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Don_Aken), [Don Luden](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Don_Luden), [Spawnfuer 25](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnfuer_25) and [Katadalanfrantaranfueristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Katadalanfrantaranfueristan). After being in the group for a month, he was invited to the DonFuer main base, [Donfuer 23](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer_23). While there, he built a 4 large ships, a slum district, and a farm.

After DonFuer 23 was griefed by [Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys), D_loaded invited Namo to his Aureus City Rebuild Project. Namo arrived first and started the process of removing lava casts and terraforming the griefed landscape. Namo spent many hours rebuilding the base, helping with the result of Aureus being rebuilt in 1 week. After the original base members were given a tour and [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) made a video on the rebuild, the rebuild project was self-griefed.

Namo was later invited to build at Donfuer 25, he had done a large amount of terraforming and built multiple scrapers and townhouses. The base was leaked a few months later by a girlfriend of one of the builders so the builders decided to self grief the base. It was revealed later that Namo was one of the people who had accidentally leaked Donfuer 25.

After a year in the group Namo had decided to retire and resign his position as a builder leaving the group, Namo still remains on good terms with many of the group members

### Halloween 2022
For Halloween 2022, Namo was invited to the [Holiday Special 22 Halloween Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Holiday_Special_22_Halloween_Base), when the [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association) members turned their Halloween base into a collaborative project with DonFuer and others. Namo built an abandoned wild west town for his the base, which was griefed by BSB soon thereafter.

After the grief Namo, was invited to another base, there was only 1 more week left until Halloween. The base was a collaborative one with DonFuer, [Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperials), [The Collective](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Collective), and others. Namo built another abandoned town and a shipyard. The base was griefed by BSB again only 2 days before Halloween, cancelling the event at the base altogether.

### Connect 4 Drama
The [Connect 4 Drama](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Connect_4_Drama) was a series of events that resulted in many bases being griefed; mainly [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) bases. Namo personally griefed an advertisement mapart built by [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer), which has previously been vandalised by [Chiekn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chiekn) and his friends.

### Don Maximus
Namo returned to 2b2t in mid-2023 and asked [Lukent](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lukent) to return to Donfuer. This was met with reservations from many high-ranking members of Donfuer, who did not trust Namo, but he was given a chance. After building at several SpawnFuers, he was invited to the at-the-time Ranger Base: [Don Maximus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Don_Maximus). He helped to expand the central town and built some roads and other decorations around the base. After the fall of Don Maximus, Namo took another extended break from 2b2t.

### 2024
Namo returned to 2b2t once again in March of 2024. He contacted Lukent once again to rejoin, and was accepted back into Donfuer. He was invited to the base [MooMoo Cowtown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MooMoo_Cowtown), which had been featured on the Donfuer Youtube Channel, where he built a small Modern Area.

Namo currently remains an active member of Donfuer.

|date_ended=February 19th, 2023}}**The Connect 4 Drama**, also controversially referred to as **DonFall**, was a drama that was sparked by DonFuer's grief of the [Bing Bong Connect 4](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bing_Bong_Connect_4) competition. It resulted in the loss of 15 DonFuer bases and builds, and triggered the group to enact a large scale membership purge of around 130 members, although many of the members, affiliates, and bases were inactive at the time of the drama.

## History
### Initial Events
{{See also|Bing Bong Connect 4}}

A 2b2t Connect 4 competition was announced by [Sven_Sven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sven_Sven) called [Bing Bong Connect 4](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bing_Bong_Connect_4), which was to star many big groups on the server. The day before the event took place, members of DonFuer turned up at the arena locations, griefing them in advance of the competition. They also attempted to grief a BSB recruit base, but found it already griefed.

Official statements from [D_loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_loaded) took credit for the griefs, branding the event as a BSB event and claiming they were in retaliation for the griefs of their own bases by BSB. This first statement was slightly walked back later on, where they continued to justify the griefs, but stated they were sympathetic to other participants.

BSB and [NamoVFX](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NamoVFX) then griefed [Trifuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Trifuer) in retaliation of the event's grief. Despite the setback, the Connect 4 event took place shortly after.

After the competition ended, The [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) would reopen applications for former members of DonFuer, while continuing to reject DonFuer members. The [Cakemasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cakemasons) would also denounce their actions, enacting a policy to reject DonFuer members as well. The [Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column) would support DonFuer, claiming they were embracing anarchy. [Zd0lf](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Zd0lf) and [waltss](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/waltss) would leak several DonFuer bases to those who attended the event. Event coordinator [KitNightingale](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KitNightingale) would inform DonFuer they would not be welcome at any further events involving the Connect 4 builders.

DonFuer would enact a membership purge, kicking out around 130 inactive, ‘reserve guard’ or suspect members and taking the opportunity to clear out the group of inactive or suspect members.

### Aftermath
In the days that followed, BSB would start a campaign against DonFuer, claiming to have destroyed many of their bases within the first day of the event. A couple of 2b2t bases would be griefed by Astral Brotherhood, as well as a further base would also be griefed by Astral Brotherhood on the Constantiam server later on. While not strictly DonFuer-related, [SBA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SBA) and [Dima788](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dima788) would also locate and grief D_loaded's 2020 Mason Lodge.

DonFuer would make another statement during this time, fully apologizing for their actions to most of the groups involved. He would join the Connect 4 voice call to clarify his position and later apologize. D_loaded would also resign from the Fifth Column during this time in order to further distance himself from the griefing community.

In total, 9 DonFuer bases/builds, 2 Bing Bong Connect 4 arenas and D_loaded's mason lodge would be griefed. The BSB recruit base and nearby Bing Bong Connect 4 mapart would be self-griefed after it was clear DonFuer had access to those co-ordinates.

DonFuer's reputation was damaged, but would recover over the following months. The event would serve as a course correction in DonFuer history, with D_loaded re-affirming their commitment to being a building and community focused group.

#### BSB Recruit Base
The BSB Recruit base was already going to be self-griefed. However, during the course of events, the timing of the self-grief changed drastically.

Initially, it was planned to be self-griefed as soon as the competition started. That changed as BSB decided to use the location to host an afterparty, during which they would set off the TNT floor layer, likely delivering a swathe of unexpected kills to prospective attendees. Once the Connect 4 bases got griefed, BSB were informed that Donfuer had the coordinates to their recruit base. The plan changed one final time, as they self-griefed the base live on Discord.

Despite the fact it was planned to be self-griefed, the timing of events led to it getting self-griefed well before the planned afterparty.

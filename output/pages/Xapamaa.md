## History
Xapamaa joined 2b2t in May 2016. He played briefly before the start of [TheCampingRusher's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) video series, finding himself with [Veteran Queue](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Veteran_Queue) as a result. After several months of playing, he found [The Monastery](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Monastery). Instead of griefing the base, he decided to base there instead. For the next few years, he spent his time at quietly building with [Marcus4761](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Marcus4761). Much of his work at the base involved intricate detailing, until February of 2020 when The Monastery was griefed.

After he lost his main base of 4 years, him and Marcus were the only active players left. A new group known as [Avalonia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Avalonia) got into contact with Marcus and asked him if he was interested in coming to their base. After seeing the base and meeting some of the members in game, the two officially joined the group. Because the base was too close to a highway, on March 5th, they moved about 50,000 blocks off axis and began work on what would be known as Avalonia. Unlike the longevity of the Monastery, however, this base only lasted until August.  Xapamaa has remained active on 2b2t.

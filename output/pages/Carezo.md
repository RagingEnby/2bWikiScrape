# Carezo

Carezo is a griefer & explorer as well as being the founding member of [TheNonBozos](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheNonBozos).

## History
Carezo joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) in December 2020 after hacking on clone anarchy servers. He met [Averil](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Averil) and became close friends with him. They griefed [DonFuer 20](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_20) together on March 13, 2021. Carezo joined the [Watchmen Revival](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Watchmen_Revival) in June 2021, and assisted them in their conflict with the [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen) at [The Homeland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Homeland). He was promoted into the leadership of the group before nuking the discord with Averil after the Guardsmen conflict slowed down.

In August 2021, Carezo founded the [TheNonBozos](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheNonBozos), a griefing group, with [soggydoggy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/soggydoggy), [Dom1405](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dom1405), and [_handyman](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_handyman). Together they griefed several [Spawnfuers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer#Rangers), as well as [Spawnfuer 20](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer), [Los Garr 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer), and [Woodkeep](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Imperials). The group slowed down in late 2021, and then ceased operating entirely in November, when Carezo was prio-banned on all of his accounts for participating in [No Server November 2021](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/No_Server_November).

Soon after this he announced an event, Sword Survival, bringing regular PvP without crystals to 2b2t, featuring notable members of the server such as [BachiBachBach](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BachiBachBach) & [HermeticLock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HermeticLock)

After a two-year hiatus, Carezo returned to the server in January 2023, helping [Xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Xcc2) in building bases all around the server as well as exposing [Rebane2001](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rebane2001) - Another event after the firsts success was announced called Sword Survival II in April 2023, although Carezo left before being able to finish this event, therefore [Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperials) took it over as a base project of their own, then Carezo left the server again that April with no explanation.

As of June 2024 he has been seen active in certain 2b2t related Discord servers showing signs he may return to the server again soon.

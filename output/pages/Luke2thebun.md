He attacked Facepunch's first base, [Camp Facepunch](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Camp_Facepunch), resulting in the beginning of the war, in which he insided and griefed many bases using at least one confirmed alt. He was notorious for his early use of a hacked client. He quit the server sometime in 2012.

## History
As a 4channer, it is likely that Luke joined sometime in early 2011, or as early as December 2010. After the invasion of the Facepunchers, Luke was significant for using an alt account, mweorz, to successfully inside the Facepunch Republic. On April 28, 2011, during an event known as Greyskull's Stand, Luke used mweorz to attack [Camp Facepunch](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Camp_Facepunch) with the use of a hacked client, killing ten Facepunchers (around half their population). Even before this event, there was some distrust of mweorz. This event marked the beginning of the Facepunch War. He would also grief other bases in the war. In May 2011, he based with his friend Tytoowns281.

One of Luke's most infamous grief was that of [passie05](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/passie05)'s Squidtown. The video of him and his friend Tytoowns281 griefing the base can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oxDLzt3ixY). He would go on to also grief many Facepunch bases. Some of his most hated enemies included [policemike55](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/policemike55) and [chezhead](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/chezhead).

Luke also has a YouTube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGuby123). It houses three relic videos from the 2011 era of 2b2t, including the previously mentioned raid on Squidtown.

The above description was given by Facepuncher Taos_Lightnin on February 28, 2013. He was likely remembering the events of the Facepunch War, as he was present at Camp Facepunch before Greyskull's Stand.

Luke2thebun quit the server sometime in 2012 after popbob hacked into his Minecraft account.

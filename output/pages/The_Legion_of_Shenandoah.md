**The Legion of Shenandoah** was a group founded in June 2014 by members of the base [Shenandoah](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shenandoah) (specifically [EX0DlSS](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/EX0DlSS) and [_Henry_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_Henry_)), which was founded a year earlier by multiple builders.
## History
Founding members EX0DlSS and _Henry_ would gradually recruit out of spawn to continue the tradition of established players bringing new players to Shenandoah as a shelter, therefore bolstering their numbers (this ideology was later seen to have flaws in it by recruiting the wrong people).
### Valkyrian Acquisition
The formation of the Legion was inspired by contact with members of [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria) during and following the [Second Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Second_Incursion). Connections between the two groups established by _Henry_ led to a union between what was left of [Fenrir](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fenrir)/[Nova](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nova) and the Legion, coming together for the first time at [Asgard II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Asgard_II) alongside other groups in the merger. The two groups worked in close collaboration from this point forwards, yet still retained their individual identities. The group's symbol is a Dragon with open wings, similar to the eagle, and their banner is a single diagonal string of green separating red and blue sides.

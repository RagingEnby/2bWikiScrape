**Space Valkyria 2**, sometimes called **Space Valk 2**, was a base created by [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa) in mid-2015 after the destruction of the original [Space Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_Valkyria). The base lasted for almost a year due to Jack locking The End from being entered, though it was eventually griefed using an illegal End portal by [Nerds Inc](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc) in early 2016, during their [Week of Destruction](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Week_of_Destruction).

## History
After the original Space Valkyria was located and griefed by [taylo112](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/taylo112), [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob) and [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) using the [/msg coordinate exploit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coordinate_exploit#%2Fmsg_coordinate_exploit), Jack traveled about 1,000 blocks away and began work on another base, Space Valkyria 2. Though this may not seem very far from the original base, The End was nothing but an empty void at this time, before the addition of the outer islands in February 2016. After Jack destroyed his bridge that he used to travel to this new site, he had no real way of knowing where he was. Due to the recent grief of Space Valkyria, The End began receiving lots of traffic from visiting, and Jack feared that his base would be found. A month into construction, Jack used an alt account to grief every known End portal on the server, cutting off access to The End for the remainder of 2015. jared2013 and the rest of [Nerds Inc](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc) knew that Jack was still in the End, but they could not get to him.

Space Valkyria 2 consisted of two builds: the main build and Space Valkyria Island. The main build was the main structure, a massive build made almost entirely out of quartz and obsidian, instead of the quartz and stone brick from Space Valkyria. This gave Space Valkyria 2 a more futuristic aesthetic than the original. Space Valkyria Island, also known as The Island of the End, was a large floating island covered in grass. He planned to make several other similar islands but got bored. Topping the island was quartz palace containing storage, farms, passive mobs, and even villagers. An enderman farm was also built nearby, and a dupe stash of infinite blocks was also present.

### Grief
In April 2016, shortly after the 1.9 update, Nerds Inc used an illegally-spawned End portal to travel to Space Valkyria 2 and grief it during their Week of Destruction. After which, they all die due to a server reboot, although they quickly return to The End after reboots abruptly end after 10 minutes. To add insult to injury, they re-griefed the original Space Valkyria on the way there. Since Jack's infinite block stash was at Space Valkyria 2, he was unable to create a successor for the base such as what he had done after the grief of Space Valkyria. However, after the [11/11 Dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/11%2F11_Dupe) of November 2016, Jack was finally able to begin work on The End's most famous build, [Space Valkyria 3](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_Valkyria_3), in early 2017.

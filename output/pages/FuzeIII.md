**FuzeIII** or **Fuze III** is a French YouTuber who came to the server and ultimately started the ill-fated [Seventh Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Seventh_Incursion). He is responsible for the creation of [Team Baguette](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Baguette), although never had an official established group of Team Baguette to fight "Team Veteran" or the Seventh Incursion. He left after losing his duel with [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit).

## YouTube
Fuze joined creating his [2b2t series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FspkDLSvk8I&list=PL1Ew0u3i4u9949W8751hbbK4paCmOq9N8). He came "in peace", and provoked a large-scale confrontation; arguably, one of the most disjointed [Spawn Incursions](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Incursions) to date. He created a loose attempt to fight "Team Veteran" or "Team Americain" with "Team Baguette." Similar to Team Rusher, it was a cooperative movement with no real centralization, just a general movement against the Seventh Incursion. Fuze continued conducting his series. The Seventh Incursion began strong with projects such as [The French Frier](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_French_Frier), however, quickly lost steam as a result of multiple factors, such as leadership changes and numerous enemies. As a result, Fuze was able to continue with his streams, consistently.

### Departure
On November 29th, 2018 at the ruins of [Aureus City](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Aureus_City), Fuze departed after losing to Fit, who brought a 32k armor set.

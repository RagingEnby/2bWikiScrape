# c1yd3i

**c1yd3i** (pronounced 'clyde') is a member of [Nerds Inc](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc).

## History
**c1yd3i** joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) in early 2014 after [KnightVista](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KnightVista) told him about the server. In late 2014, he met [Rustle_League](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rustle_League). The two decided to travel as far away from spawn as they could. After tiring of travel, c1yd3i and Rustle_League started construction of [Kool Kids Klub](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kool_Kids_Klub). Eventually, the base was griefed as it was very close to the highway. This lead to the former members to join [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria) through which c1yd3i participated in the [Third Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Third_Incursion).

After [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria) disbanded, c1yd3i griefed [New Niggintown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/New_Niggintown) and began griefing with increasing regularity. He befriended [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan), [C4RTM4N](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/C4RTM4N), and [fr1kin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fr1kin), and later joined [Nerds Inc](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc). He later caused the self-grief of [New Argonath](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/New_Argonath) in 2021 after attempting to sell its coordinates.

## History
### Early History
Larry joined 2b2t at the end of 2019 just to check it out but during the summer of 2020 when he got bored due to COVID-19 lockdowns he wanted to become active again. After watching a few videos about 2b2t, he got excited and decided to he wanted to make videos himself. He started making YouTube videos about his adventures, calling the series "Exploring 2b2t." He's made more than 300 episodes of this series! At first, it was called "Journey to the World Border," but he changed the name because he didn't want to go to
the border anymore. He later started another series called from zero to hero on 2b2t what was very successful.

### Membership in Backstreet Boys
As Larry spent more time on the server, he made some friends and a few enemies too. He met [Digandbuilder](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Digandbuilder), who was quite popular on the server. Larry joined one of the events organized by [The Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Backstreet_Boys), a well-known group. Surprisingly, on his very first event, he got the "recruit" role, This made him a part of [The Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Backstreet_Boys), his first big group on 2b2t. Larry started making videos about his experiences at the group's bases and made a bunch of friends there.

### Success on Youtube
Around this time, Larry's YouTube channel also started getting more views and subscribers. Being a member of [The Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Backstreet_Boys) made him more recognizable on the server. His journey and his connection with the group got people interested in his content, and he became more well-known in the 2b2t community.

### The Start of Luminaria
In December 2021, Larry reunited with his old buddy from when he started on the server, [HexW](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HexW). This friend had a cool idea â€“ to create a new group called [Luminaria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Luminaria). This group later became known as the starting point for the well-known 2b2t shop, [NoxShop](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NoxShop). Larry thought it was cool and invited his friends like [RLbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/RLbob) and [OliverIguess](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/OliverIguess) to join. [RLbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/RLbob) also introduced [Franknificant](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Franknificant) to the group.
As [Luminaria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Luminaria) grew, they did a bunch of things, including making different bases. One of their big projects was an underground base called [NoxTown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NoxTown). But sadly, [NoxTown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NoxTown) got griefed because of a problem with coordinate exploit. So, RLbob, Larry, and the other leaders decided to make a new base called [Veritas](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Veritas).While they were at [Veritas](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Veritas), Larry had a cool idea. He suggested they buy a huge stash in 2b2t and use it to start a shop. Everyone liked the idea and they got the stash. This was the end for [Luminaria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Luminaria),

### The Nox Shop Drama
Following the acquisition of the stash by the owners of [Luminaria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Luminaria), also known as the "dragons," it was temporarily moved to Veritas in order to kick-start the shop's operations. Once everything was arranged, the dragons shifted the stash to a distant location to ensure its safety. While [RLbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/RLbob) and Larry were not the most active participants in the shop, they contributed primarily at Veritas, whereas [HexW](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HexW), [YofishIscool](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YofishIscool), [Qsp](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Qsp), and [senakot](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/senakot) took charge of shop-related activities. The group enjoyed a smooth run until March 19th, 2022, when a troubling incident unfolded. [Gravixous](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Gravixous) sent a video depicting a violent scene set to Minecraft music to the group. An administrator swiftly intervened, banning [Gravixous](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Gravixous) and reprimanding him. However, unbeknownst to the group, RLbob had sent the same video two months prior. The plot thickened as Gravixous managed to gather the coordinates to Veritas, leveraging a screen-sharing incident in the general voice chat to his advantage. Warned by a friend about potential trouble, Gravixous proceeded to the base, ultimately destroying it. But the tale didn't end there. [Franknificant](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Franknificant), RLbob, Gravixous, and Larry's confidante, seized the opportunity to access the Nox Shop stash due to Frank's possession of illegal items that RLbob had stashed there. Although Bob and Larry were unaware of Frank's intention, Gravixous was privy to the plan and agreed to assist in the heist. Swiftly executed, the stash was pilfered, catching the dragons off-guard. An account on Discord named Movingbuissnes2006 messaged them the stash coordinates a few hours later. Franknificant then orchestrated the relocation of the stash, a maneuver that took place while he was in voice chat with the unsuspecting dragons, aiding them in their investigation. This encounter was clandestinely recorded by Franknificant and is available on his YouTube channel as an external link at the bottom of the wiki page.
Subsequently, when Bob was informed of Frank's involvement, Larry and Frank experienced a fallout. The Nox Shop took decisive action, ejecting both Larry and Bob from its ranks. The fallout rippled through [Luminaria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Luminaria), causing a period of dormancy that persisted until the present day. Larry, deeply affected by the disintegration of a group he had invested substantial time in, retreated from the scene for about a month to regather his focus. Eventually, Larry and Bob rallied and regained momentum. Miraculously, Larry and Frank reconciled their differences, rekindling their friendship.

### Decline of Activity
After [Luminaria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Luminaria) ended, Larry's video-making slowed down a lot. He used to make videos about [Luminaria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Luminaria) bases, but since that was over, he didn't have as much to show. Instead of making a video almost every day, he started making about three videos a week at most, and he still does that now. He tried spending time with his first group, [The Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Backstreet_Boys), but they were in a period of inactivity. Then, in 2023, Larry joined a new group called the [Cakemasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cakemasons), led by [Kizzycocoa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kizzycocoa). His time in the group was short, and just a month later, despite having not been active enough to warrant rule breaking, Larry and another member, RLbob, were banned without warning. Even though he wasn't playing on 2b2t actively, Larry still got caught up in drama with the Cakemasons which ended up in him leaving BSB.

Larry would go on to become inactive on the 2builders2tools server, and in contrast become more active in external communities related to the server.

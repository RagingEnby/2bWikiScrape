# BIKMUNNI

**BIKMUNNI** is a newfag who is a respected basehunter, streamer, and shop owner. He also notably discovered the [Unbreakable Equipment Dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Duplication_glitch).

## History
BIKMUNNI joined 2b2t on April 21, 2020. Having joined after a period of many duplication glitches, he quickly got established on the server. BIKMUNNI's early days on the server were characterized by his basehunting streams and other content on the server. During one of BIKMUNNI's first 2b2t streams the player [ANALP0RN](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ANALP0RN), who was watching noticed that BIKMUNNI's coordinates were being leaked in his chat by his Kami Blue Stashfinder. This would lead to ANALP0RN adding BIKMUNNI on discord under the account name "Mikeeee___" and sending him coordinates to his first major stash.

BIKMUNNI would spend the following months basehunting, collecting items, and building on 2b2t. Upon the leak of the Pyro Dupe, BIKMUNNI would begin duplicating his items from the time the dupe was leaked to its patch. His unrivaled dedication to basehunting and his use of the [Pyro Dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Duplication_glitch) would put BIKMUNNI up there with some of 2b2t's richest players going into 2021. During this time, BIKMUNNI also gained relevancy for finding many elytra-flight related bypasses on 2b2t along with the opening of his item shop. Towards the end of 2020, BIKMUNNI's long time connection ANALP0RN would share coordinates to one of his stashes with BIKMUNNI again - this time as a farewell leading into a period of inactivity - asking that BIKMUNNI leave the stash in place and to not share coordinates with anyone. BIKMUNNI would betray him and share coordinates with Mad_King_Lambo and others and steal the entire stash- marking the end of their friendship.

BIKMUNNI would continue to stockpile his wealth on 2b2t and collect rare signed books throughout 2021. During the fall of 2021, BIKMUNNI would start to experiment with illegal items, after hearing words about them returning. He would acquire a large collection of illegal items that had not been seen since illegals were removed in late 2019. He would also start experiencing with unbreakable items, after discovering that they were still usable. Two days before the 2022 new year, BIKMUNNI would upload a [now famous video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVF6fg8jAf4) on YouTube of an Unbreakable Equipment Duplication glitch on 2b2t. BIKMUNNI would continue playing with fluctuating frequency following his usual trends of gameplay throughout 2022.

Going into 2023 BIKMUNNI had been invited to and joined [The Ancients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ancients) and began to build and interact with them. In mid-2023, BIKMUNNI decided to stop operating his well known shop on the server, and wanted to sell his shop-stash. After the sale of this stash, BIKMUNNI no longer operated any IRL-business on the server.

## Orsond and Cornerbase Controversy
BIKMUNNI was part of a large collaboration base between many players in the End Dimension. This base being the now infamous [Corner Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Corner_Base). The base relied on the use of an exploit known as Boat TP to go to and from the base without long and dangerous travel in the open end. The base was insided and zipoffs teleported [The Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column) to the base. Following the grief of the base, [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) would release a video detailing the base and the exploit. In this video, Fit explains that the base had been leaked by BIKMUNNI and showed screenshots sent to him by [Orsond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Orsond) that painted a clear picture of what had happened.

However, it would come out that these pictures were falsified- and that BIKMUNNI was innocent in the griefing of the base. Following the release of relevant discord messages that further proved BIKMUNNI's innocence, [Orsond would be banned from the wiki](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Wiki:Ban_Status_of_User_Orsond) after his cyberbullying campaign against BIKMUNNI was exposed. This event only further cemented the lack of care and fact checking put into Fit's videos.

}}**Anatolia** was a 2013 base and home of the **Black Flag Group**. Its members were [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86), [Pyrobyte](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pyrobyte) and [Drewbookman](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Drewbookman). The Black Flag group is most known for being one of the founders for [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria), the other one being the [Hitlerwood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hitlerwood) crew (prior to the merging of the [Gape Group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Gape_Group) and the [Legion of Shenandoah](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Legion_of_Shenandoah)). Anatolia was mostly made of cobblestone, usually via [lavacast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/lavacast)s, or hand-placed.

## History
It was Sato86's first base, and named after a map in *Age of Mythology*. He first invited drewbookman after talking with him in chat. Drewbookman suggested Sato86 invite the player Pyrobyte, and he invited him too. They also started a small spawn base, called the Argo Outpost.

During the [1.4.7 dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Duplication_glitch), the members of Anatolia duped away and also made infinite items. A stash was created a couple of thousand blocks from the base in the middle of a sea. The infinite stash was eventually shared with [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan) during the second [backdoor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backdoors#Second_Backdoor). The infinite items used to build Wrath during the [Third Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Third_Incursion) came from this base. During this time, [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan) and Pyrobyte using the second backdoor created illegal items, including [pig spawners](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Illegal_items#Hacked_Items_disabled_by_Hausemaster). These spawners were eventually recovered by [kinorana](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/kinorana). iTristan, and [fr1kin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fr1kin) emptied the stash in 2016.

### Controversy
A couple of days after the [First Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/First_Incursion) in June 2013, Drewbookman griefed parts of [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria_(Base)). Drewbookman trusted a player named Hinderjd, who was also a member of [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria) and gave his solo base coordinates to him. Hinderjd came to Drew's base, along with KnightVista and [Coldwave](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coldwave), and griefed it. Hinderjd then killed Drewbookman. After this event, there would be a lot more drama between Drewbookman and Sato86. Drewbookman then returned to Anatolia and threatened to leak the coordinates to the dismay of Pyrobyte and Sato86. Drewbookman wasn't aware of the stash near the base, so the other members were worried that he would discover and loot it. Pyrobyte hatched a plan to grief the base and frame Drewbookman for it so that the stash wouldn't be uncovered.

Pyrobyte griefed the base and announced it with a screenshot. In the screenshot, the base is lavacasted and blown up, which Pyrobyte claimed was done by Drew. The water in the screenshot had not finished flowing down from the base, making it look like it had just been griefed. People took notice and were suspicious that Pyrobyte had just griefed the base himself, instead of finding the base griefed. Years later, Sato86 confirmed that the base was griefed by them. However, he still blamed Drewbookman for the grief, because if he never had started the drama by returning to Anatolia or griefing parts of Valkyria, the entire feud would have never gone down, and Pyrobyte would never have griefed Anatolia.

}}**Wingston** is a private spawn building group. Their bases can be recognized by the view tower built as a centrepiece with each new version by the leader [Warske](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Warske).
## Early History
[Warske](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Warske) started Wingston on November 1st, 2022 to build a base with [Dima788](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dima788). Warske came up with the name Wingston and started a discord group while Dimaa788 found a location for the first base, Wingston I. They initially co-lead the group, with important decisions (such as invites, kicks, changes to the group, etc.) needing to have both of their agreement. Gradually, more players were invited and the first base was founded.

## Bases
### Wingston I
On November 2nd, 2022, Warske started building the centrepiece of the first base just over 100k out from [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn). He started a trend there common through Wingston Group bases where Warske built a different famous viewing tower as the centerpiece. For Wingston I, he used [Berlin Television Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernsehturm_Berlin) as a reference. When finished with the tower, he made streets departing from the centerpiece as places for other members to build. Warske also built a gate based on the [Brandenburg Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandenburg_Gate) and a factory building where he kept the base's building materials. The bases members, such as [Blaksaber21](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Blaksaber21) and [Tensive](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tensive) started building. On the 6th of December, the base was griefed by [maksitaxi](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/maksitaxi), Later it became clear that [Alfie05](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Alfie05) had leaked the base and was kicked out of the group as a result.

### Wingston II
On the December 20th, 2022, Warske began construction on Wingston II. Like the previous base, Warske built a view tower as a centerpiece, this time using the [CN Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CN_Tower) as his reference. He also built a road network again. The base was griefed by maksitaxi after existing only one day due to leaks from  many new members, including members invited without Warske's approval. After the grief of Wingston II, Dima788 kicked all members of the group without consulting Warske. Because of repeated violations of the only concrete rule for the groups leadership (all important decisions needing to be agreed upon by Warske and Dima788), Warske remove Dima788 from the group, and continued the group's activities.

### Wingston III
A day after the grief of Wingston II Warske began constructing on Wingston III alone. Blaksaber was the first one to be invited back in the group. Because Warske considered him a friend and trustworthy. Warske came up with a council role and gave it to blaksaber. Now that Dima was no longer a leader Warske felt it was important to hear the opinion of another member. Around this time, Warske also started doing polls more often for important decisions (invites, base decisions,...). gradually new people were invite until the number of members as before. Because the base was so close to spawn, a stash hunter called [Neria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Neria) discovered the base after a few weeks of existence, he and a friend of his [themarty](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/themarty) with whom he had shared the coordinates were inducted into the group and later became members as well. On January 18 when [Atket](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Atket) passed by the base, he noticed some damage had been done to the base. the person responsible for this is still unknown to the group. Warske started a vote whether the group should repair the base and continue, or start a new one. The group chose to already start the next base, Wingston IV. only Warske did not share this information with all members because he no longer trusted certain members after the attack on Wingston III, which is why Warske created a temporary discord where the new base was announced. Later it became clear that themarty had leaked the base to Vertz, and not much later Dima had obtained the coordinates of Wingston III, resulting in the destruction of the base. Dima made it a long quest to find the base after he was kicked. Warske made a Reddit post to thank all members of Wingston and announced the end of the group, while the group had already secretly started the new base, this to avoid the attention of potential griefers.

### Wingston IV
On February 2, 2023, Warske and Blaksaber started building the street grid for Wingston IV, Warske built a reconstruction of the Stuttgart observation deck as centerpiece before announcening the new base to the trusted members. on February 11, after Dima had already griefed Wingston III and TheMarty and Vertz had been kicked out of the group, the main discord was put back into use and the new base was announced. The theme of this base was a realistic contemporary city. [YoMoBoYo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YoMoBoYo) built a brick factory, [Joey](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) built a Astral themed house, [metalbunny](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/metalbunny) built a New York themed building, [Phos](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Phosph0lipid) made different modern buildings, [Blaksaber](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Blaksaber) built different brick buildings, Warske built many highrisers, a railway and elevated highway. Many more newly invited people would also construct their buildings. Around the end of Wingston IV, Warske added [Lukent](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lukent) and [N8](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/N8TT) to the group, they provided a proxy system so people could access the base faster, later they were promoted to Council members. Eventually one of the new members shared a rough location description of the base in the [cakemasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CakeMasons) discord, [Pixelati0n](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pixelati0n) a known griefer who was in the cakemasons discord wanted to make it his job to find Wingston IV. Pixelati0n proposed a deal to Warske whereby if he was invited before he found the base, he would leave the base alone. Warske knowing about Pixel's past did not accept this and eventually on May 21, Pixelati0n found the base, resulting in its destruction.

### Wingston V
After the grief of Wingston IV, Warske immediatly started working on the next one, this time Warske decided to do the spawnbase in the end. The base was deliberately built on the other side of end spawn so that The Isle base of the Spawn Masons that was active around that time was not accidentally visited by Wingston members. Warske started by connected several islands with bridges and began constructing the new telivision tower, which was inspired by the Ostankino Tower from Moscow. Next to the main island, an island was dedicated to an industrial area, several factory buildings were built by [Nasder](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nasder), Blaksaber, [Yomilo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Yomilo) and Warske. N8 would also build a factory building on another island. Later, phosph0lipid built a futuristic building and Toska a downtown building. The base became inactive after the server update in August and was eventually discovered months later by a Japanese group who removed the signboard and placed their own signs. As the base had been inactive for several months, Warske decided not to take much action and finally on 2nd January 2024, the base was griefed by a player called rolkoz who made a video about it.

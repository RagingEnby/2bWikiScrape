# chezhead

**chezhead** is the founder and the former President of the [Facepunch Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Facepunch_Republic).

## â€‹History
chezhead joined 2b2t on April 27, 2011, after seeing an advertisement on facepunch.com promoting 2b2t. chezhead built Camp Facepunch the day he joined. He attempted to organize the Facepunchers, and they based at Camp Facepunch. The next day, the battle of grey skulls took place, and the Facepunch War began. Camp Facepunch was griefed by [Luke2thebun](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Luke2thebun) after only one day. chezhead would make more bases during the war and they would nearly all be quickly griefed by the established population on the server.  Around August, the Facepunch Republic began a sharp decline. In October 2011, chezhead had seemed to have left 2b2t for good.

In November 2019, chezhead returned to 2b2t after [Armorsmith](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith) contacted him [through reddit](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/510916954295500810/650633047720460309/unknown-10.png), offering him to create a new Facepunch Republic to enslave other factions. This plan failed, chezhead banned Armorsmith and created a new group with [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86), which would later become the [Facepunch Federation](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Facepunch_Federation).

### Upon the Shoulders of Giants
*Upon the Shoulders of Giants* was a [Facepunch Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Facepunch_Republic) post created on April 27, 2011 by Chezhead. This later created a large group and retroactively became the first post of the Facepunch Republic. It can alternatively and commonly be seen as one of the first times a large influx of players joined due to a form of media tracking attention. It is archived [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20150227061609/https://facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1083343)

## Legacy
Chezhead is almost personally responsible for the Facepunch influx of early 2011 as he was a well-respected member of the Facepunch forums however he personally sees himself as "a small blip in the history of 2b2t".

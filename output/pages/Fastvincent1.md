## On 2b2t
fastvincent1 joined after seeing TheCampingRusher's post about 2b2t on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQbnPn5BM-E). He played on his alt ReallyDamnFast and got 10,000 blocks out, but was killed by mobs. He quit for a few months and returned in mid-2017. He got a kit and created a base called "Hamlet" with his friends [Endermqn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Endermqn) and [Jimyy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jimyy). However, on April 10th, 2022 Hamlet was griefed by a player named NamoVFX; the base lasted nearly 5 years. He left his alt at Hamlet and joined on his then alt, fastvincent1, at spawn, which is now his main. He was a part of the group Conquest before their leader retired in 2019 and he was promoted to leader. The group declined after Vincent took over, and it eventually was near-completely dead. He now streams his activities on YouTube, such as basehunting.

## Media
fastvincent1 made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMpfUuJelps) on his alternative YouTube account [HeyItsFast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6PHrjtAHonelbqcIMiEFiA), making [Southern Canal](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Southern_Canal) acid shaders. With good reception, it prompted vincent to create more content. He eventually began on his (now main) YouTube channel, fastvincent1, inspired mainly by [SalC1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SalC1), [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit), and especially [BarrenDome](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BarrenDome). He began with his [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA_wFI1TdvM) on the Water Cube. Gaining good reception again, he made more videos, all in a series named "2B2T Archives," the title later forgotten. He currently has over 70,000 subscribers and is well known in the 2b2t community.
### The Anarchy Podcast
fastvincent1 hosts [The Anarchy Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADGXA4rsQHw), with his co-host being [DigMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Digandbuilder). After the old host, Super, left for college, Vincent and Dig began making the interviews and then sending them to Super to upload them; however, Super eventually stopped responding to them, and so they created a new channel for the podcasts, called [The Fast Cast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnR_HEPZy0pfVK0lu9nf-1Q). He also has many YouTube interviews on his channel, most notably being [Chezhead](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chezhead) and a past [2b2t helper/admin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster#List_of_Admins) known as Benjojo.

**chrisleighton** was an [oldfag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Terminology#O) and server regular that played from 2011 to mid-2012. He was known to be quite a sadistic player to the general community, through his claims to be 'king' of 2b2t and griefs. He created a lava spawn trap at (0,0), which instantly killed respawning and new players.

### Beginnings

Chrisleighton was known for lava-trapping (0,0) and is thought to have "begun" the tradition of spawn killing. He was also on record to have dug early parts of the [+X Axis Highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/%2BX_Axis_Highway).

### King
Chrisleighton was infamous for spamming the chat with this message: "CHRISLEIGHTON IS THE KING OF 2B2T! U MAD N****RS! U MAD NEWFAGS!". He spammed it so widely that most just accepted it to stop him from spamming it. The /ignore command was not present during this time, so there was no way to prevent his chat spamming apart from affirming his view.

Most of his base-mates and other 2b2t players tolerated him, until one day when [x0XP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/x0XP) had become sick of his ego and presence as 'king' of 2b2t. x0XP spoke to chris's real-life friend [SnackyNorph](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SnackyNorph) and was able to get chris's mobile phone number. [x0XP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/x0XP) later used this to dox him and had [SionThePhion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SionThePhion) call him. This caused chris to quit playing on 2b2t in response for good.

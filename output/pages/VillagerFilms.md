## History
### Beginnings
VillagerFilms joined 2b2t in late 2017, and wandered the server until February 2018, when he met KingOda. They based together with others until the group was insided by [Miggers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Miggers).
The group created several other small bases, but none of these were long-lasting. VillagerFilms played much slower until September 2018.

### Return
VillagerFilms returned in September 2018, in lieu of the [7th Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/7th_Incursion). He participated in the second stage of the incursion briefly. Afterwards, VillagerFilms met Patch, who invited him to [Magnostadt](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Magnostadt). He later joined the [Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys) and became a member of the [Infinity Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinity_Incursion) through his participation in the [8th Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/8th_Incursion). He founded [Team Galactic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Galactic) and participated briefly. VillagerFilms joined the [NFPR](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NFPR) in early 2020, where he was Vice President for several months.

### YouTube
VillagerFilms had always been interested in YouTube content creation, however it wasn't until February 2020 that he would began creating history videos on his personal channel. He made a few videos covering topics such as The Great Decay, Facepunch and others. However, in Summer 2020, VillagerFilms stopped making content for a long time. This was because on April 1st 2020, VillagerFilms started the [2b2t Chronicles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Chronicles), and is the main director of it to this day. Nowadays, VillagerFilms mainly focuses on the [2b2t Chronicles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Chronicles), very occasionally logging into 2b2t itself, but remaining active within the community.

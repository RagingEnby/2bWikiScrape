}}**Endhaven** was a long-term million-base in the End founded by [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) and [Krobar01](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Krobar01) in 2022. It was the location of a variety of builds including Krobar01’s Ring, Joey_Coconut’s Basilica, and [YoMoBoYo’s](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YoMoBoYo) Citadel.
## History
### Pre-Foundation
In January 2022, [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) began traveling in the End in order to start a new base there after being alerted to [BoatTP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BoatTP) by [Harrissssonn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Harrissssonn), and also having Harrissssonn unknowingly basehunt a trail near to [Five Isles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Five_Isles), which concerned the base members as they’d not known him. This came several weeks after [Endtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Endtopia) had been griefed, which up to then had been Krobar’s main focus in the End dimension. Joey and Krobar decided to start a new base, which Joey would travel to the location for.

He died back to spawn several times before including Krobar in the travel procedure, where Joey traveled ~500k at a time, put together a BoatTP setup, teleported Krobar to his location, set up a [Pearl dock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ender_pearl_loading), and continued traveling farther out in order to preserve travel progress. The travel path was made to be as difficult as possible to chunktrail. There was no goal in mind other than to get as far as possible before tiring out or an eventual BoatTP patch.

### Foundation
After traveling for three months, Joey_Coconut decided that ~5 million blocks from End spawn was far enough, and teleported Krobar out to the end of the trail, where they fake base called ‘Endtropilis Gigabase’ to try and hide the real base. Joey then doubled back and traveled back towards spawn, choosing the location for Endhaven a few hours later. While travel had been underway, Joey and Krobar had discussed who they would invite to the eventual base. Continuing the trend from their previous bases together, Krobar funded the base, while Joey brought basemates to build with the two of them. The initial members of the base (excepting Terbin, who had been immediately invited) were selected from the leadership of the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood). After teleporting out [smcz19](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/smcz19), [A97J](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/A97J), [LordGalvatronMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/LordGalvatronMC), and later [Enchoseon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Enchoseon), the base sat dormant for half a year while the base’s members built at Five Isles and various Astral bases.

### Construction
Throughout late 2022, Krobar01 designed the Ring, Joey began design on his Basilica.
In November 2022, Krobar01 brought a stash to the base and began construction of the Ring following several months of design. Meanwhile, Joey began construction on Lazarbor, and also began construction of Space Menegroth with smcz19.
After several months of activity at the base, Krobar completed the Ring.  It was meant at first to simply be a quick change of pace before his return to Five isles, but following the base’s self-grief in December, Krobar became largely inactive on 2b and opted to play on [Constantiam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Constantiam) for a time. Joey and smcz continued intermittently at the base, with smcz constructing much of Space Menegroth throughout early 2023, and Joey finishing Lazarbor in May 2023
[RICELAND1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/RICELAND1), [cpybara](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/cpybara), [YoMoBoYo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YoMoBoYo), and [xrayessay](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xrayessay) were added to the base in mid 2023, which resulted in YoMoBoYo beginning construction on his Citadel. Joey also began construction of his Basilica.

### Discovery
After the initial update to 1.19, the base members were split as to what to do, and although parts of the stash were severely depleted or outright deleted, the base was functionally un-findable due to chunk culling. Following the reversion of the update and the new version of the 1.19 update, terrain generation in the end changed and made the 1.12 trail significantly more visible.
[Harrissssonn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Harrissssonn) had been basehunting the End dimension continuously and effectively for months before the update, flying in large rings to discover chunk-trails and then cataloging them for later exploration. This effectively bypassed the base’s entire security setup as he found both the trail to and from the fake base Endtropilis from flying a ring 5 million from spawn. He did not rob or grief the base, with the members themselves only finding out he had visited later on.

### Continued Construction & Self-grief
Activity at the base continued on and off throughout 2024. Amidst concerns over the trail to the base now being visible without a hacked client, [Skai256](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Skai256) and [Legendbake](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Legendbake) were invited to help complete in-progress builds there in case of discovery by base hunters. These concerns were only heightened following the public release of an end-dimension-compatible newchunks software.
With Skai and LegendBake’s help, YoMo’s Citadel and Joey’s Basilica were completed. YoMo has since stated that his Citadel was just much Bake's as it is his due to his efforts, whereas Joey has since stated that his Basilica wouldn't have been possible without Skai's help. RICELAND1 designed statues for the Basilica's interior, xrayessay completed his nautilus, smcz began construction of a scale model of the solar system, and Enchoseon began construction of her tree. Alongside the efforts to complete in-progress builds, all stashes at the base were moved from the base over several months. After stash movement was completed in late August, the base sat dormant before ultimately being self-griefed by Joey_Coconut, Legendbake, Skai256, YoMoBoYo and made public on November 24, 2024.

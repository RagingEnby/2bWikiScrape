}}**Fitlantis** was built by [FitMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FitMC) and was his first solo base since 2014. This base was discovered using the coordinate exploit of late 2016 by [ChromeCrusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ChromeCrusher). Fitlantis was griefed by multiple players after the base was compromised.

## Construction
Built inside a drained ocean monument, Fitlantis was the first base ever created on 2b2t to have its entire construction be posted in video form. Among the base's most notable structures were his bedroom, a kitchen, the hallway with a dark oak tree inside, his gym and the central hall, beneath which is the open bedrock which allowed the coordinates to be discovered.

Fit has the entire construction process of Fitlantis on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHZ986wm_sJT6wntdDTIIcw) and filmed the construction through multiple YouTube livestreams.

## Griefing
On the 6th of November, 2016, the bedrock coordinate exploit of late 2016 was used by [ChromeCrusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ChromeCrusher) to reveal the location of Fitlantis. This allowed a group of random people to travel to the base and grief it. During this time, a battle occurred between the random people who showed up to grief the base and [Team Aurora](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Aurora). On April 21, 2017, Fitlantis was again destroyed by lavacasts and flooding.

Over three years after the base's destruction, [Fit travelled to the ruins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgamLkNHSVs), and noted how it was all but unrecognizable; lavacasts were littered above the base, water had once again flooded inside, and guardians were now spawning again on mass.

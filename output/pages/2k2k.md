**2k2k** was one of the most notable monuments and bases near [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn) on 2b2t. The base's name was given by the players of 2b2t due to its coordinates being at X:-2000, Z:-2000 (similar to **[Negative Fourhundred Eighthundred](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NFE_(Negative_Fourhundred_Eighthundred))**). The base was built sometime in July 2012 as the last known base of the [Facepunch Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Facepunch_Republic) before their disbandment (if [Hitlerwood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hitlerwood) isn't counted, which could be considered to be created after the republic).

It was later griefed, raided, and covered in a mountainous [lavacast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/lavacast). After being rebuilt, restored, remodeled and preserved (under the lavacast) multiple times, its final blows were dealt continuously over the years. The [New Facepunch Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/New_Facepunch_Republic) attempted to reconstruct it but ended up retreating from the project and continuing with [8k8k](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/8k8k).

## History
2k2k existed as early as April 1, 2012, at which time it contained "a place to stay, a farm, and animals". Facepunchers led by [Phagocytic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Phagocytic) moved to the base after [Zion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Zion), built in July 2011, was griefed in April 2012. To honor this base, they decided to rename 2k2k to Zion, but unfortunately, this name was eventually forgotten and the original Zion was wiped away from server history until 2019, when the base was rediscovered on an old Facepunch thread.

In the final days of [the Facepunch War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Facepunch_War), 2k2k served as the last base and stronghold for a shatter of the [Facepunch Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Facepunch_Republic). By this point, the Republic was in shambles. [Chezhead](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chezhead) had lead the Republic poorly and the [4channers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4channers) were quickly pressing in, the remaining Facepunchers tried to keep it together but failed and the Republic died in February 2012.

One of the last bands of Facepunchers still loyal to their fallen Republic, lead by [Phagocytic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Phagocytic), decided to create a spawn base in order to continuously rebuild 2k2k in hopes that the 4channers would eventually give up on destroying the base, but the Facepunchers gradually began to get tired of rebuilding the base and many lost hope. Due to this, the Facepunchers lost their final stand and the last of the old Republic was destroyed with 2k2k, being obliterated sometime in June of 2012.

2k2k formerly lay in a large cobblestone tomb, after tens, possibly hundreds of [lavacasts](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lavacast) were dumped upon it. Some of its original structure remained and players such as [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) attempted restorations of the base, with many restored rooms being discoverable within the casts. Of course, these didn't last too long but people continued to restore the base periodically until [TheCampingRusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) joined.

2k2k was buried into the floor in 2016-2019 after it got griefed even harder. The combination of repeated lavacasting and griefing turned it into a massive crater comparable to spawn.

### New Facepunch Republic Repair Attempts
In November 2019, members of the [New Facepunch Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/New_Facepunch_Republic) tried to rebuild 2k2k. The entire lavacast was removed and a little camp created. After a week, [Armorsmith](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith) decided to destroy it again with withers.

In January 2020, another repair was done by members of the New Facepunch Republic. This new 2k2k was spearheaded first by [gabethebabe1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/gabethebabe1), who was joined later by [Jeffrey_214](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jeffrey_214). During the repair, a majority of 2k2k was rebuilt, as a monument to the old base. This 2k2k looked different than the original, but was built with original blocks and kept the same building style. It was disturbed by small griefs a few times but for a while the repair was completely successful. The whole underground stronghold, nicknamed the Citadel, was even restored. The build lasted almost a month before it was destroyed yet again by an unknown griefer.

In July 2020, Michael_Poole along with a few initiates left their bases to repair 2k2k. A castle, a market, and several garden areas were made. Later, [HAUSEVULT](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HAUSEVULT) and [househousehouse1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/househousehouse1) griefed the base, and Michael and the Facepunchers left to tend to other building projects.

On July 17th, 2020, [Mewdopie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mewdopie) came to 2k2k to make The 2b2t Zion Temple. Mewdopie was able to create the structure using the original block palette, and some obsidian. Later that day, [Fredmodulars](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fredmodulars) came to 2k2k and blew up the base, but did not destroy the temple.

## Trivia
*2k2k was also referred to as [Zion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Zion) for a while, as a way to carry on the legacy of the original base. This name caused many to believe that Zion and 2k2k were the same base later on.
*Since 2k2k was built around the time when Beta 1.7.3 was released, there were few building blocks available. Instead, [Facepunchers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Facepunch_Republic) created the base out of stone slabs, cobblestone, wood, glass, and sandstone, building incredibly detailed hallways and arches that truly gave it an ancient feeling. Example: https://youtu.be/HqfJmvZlqDw
*While many people think that 2k2k is located at X:2000 Z:2000, its actual coordinates are X:-2000 Z:-2000. This led to the positive 2k2k being lavacasted over many times due to the confusion, while the actual location of 2k2k was blown into the floor.
*[Armorsmith's Followers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith%27s_Followers) built a base at 2k2k's coordinates at the [End](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_End), named [Space 2k2k](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_2k2k).

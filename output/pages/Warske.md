**Warske** is a builder and a member of many building groups. He built at many well-known bases such as [Sky Masons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sky_Masons), [DonFuer 25](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_25) and [Gysdall](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Gysdall), which was founded and built solely by him. In late 2022 he also founded his own group, [Wingston](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Wingston).
## History
### Early History
Warske joined 2b2t in August 2020 to make a base together with some friends of his including [Jenskeee123](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jenskeee123), [NaiveOposeum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NaiveOposeum) and [Jef_2005](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jef_2005). He founded [Gysdall](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Gysdall) on October 5th, 2020. Here, he built intermittently for over a year, building a town, a church, and many other structures. On 2nd April, the base was found by a stash hunter named [Blaksaber21](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Blaksaber21), and it was griefed by the [Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys). After the Backstreet Boys uploaded their [grief video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRSJNbl7sqc) on YouTube, Warske received requests to join several building groups. Tired of being isolated for over a year and a half, he eagerly wanted to join some groups.

### Participation in Groups
One of the first groups Warske was introduced to was [The Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Republic). After a vote within the group, he was quickly accepted, and went on to build the capitol at [Nuremburg](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Republic), but it would get griefed before its completion.
Warske was also introduced to the [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons) by [rebane2001](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/rebane2001). In 2020, he discovered the location of Gysdall through 2b2t's mapart wall. Warske was invited to [Sky Masons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sky_Masons) and built a futuristic island while he was a guest there, later Warske also participated in a Masons/ancients end base, here he built an Italian city based on the architecture in Tuscany with a bridge based on an actual bridge in Florence, Ponte Vecchio. Warske also received an invitation from the leader of [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer), [D_loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_loaded), to join the group. Warske had originally been inspired by DonFuer bases, and joined the group. After building a gate castle at [SpawnFuer 26](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnFuer_26) and a domed church inspired by [Frederick's Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederik%27s_Church) at a Ranger base called [Katadalanfrantaranfueristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Katadalanfrantaranfueristan), he was promoted and given access to the main DonFuer bases, and built a castle at [DonFuer 23](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_23) and part of [DonFuer 25](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_25). He would later participate at many more Donfuer bases such as [The Blue Castle](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Blue_Castle), [FutureFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FutureFuer) and [Collab Fuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Collab_Fuer).

In the summer of 2022 Warske was invited to [SBA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SBA) by [DanDucky](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DanDucky). Warske's first build at a SBA base was a Japanese-themed tower at [SBA 40](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association). Warske would later participate in many more SBA bases. Late summer of 2022, Warske was added to Astral Brotherhood's newest main base, [Dubrovnik](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dubrovnik), here he built a castle and a village attached to it. Early 2023 Warske took part in [Block Game Babylon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Babylon), a base project led by [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut), here he built a Russian Orthodox church in the mountain area of the base. In March, Warske was invited to participate in the [SpawnQuarium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnQuarium) event, a building project where a large group of players built ocean-related builds in the water cube of spawn, here he built a sunken titanic. Warske also competed at Fort Concord, a spawnbase that holds the record of most participants.

### Solo projects
Warske's most impressive Solo project was his first base [Gysdall](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Gysdall) constructed between 2020â€”2021. The base represented a medieval city and was built entirely without the use of stashes, which made the build progression very slow and tiring. Warske also constructed several solo builds on the server, mostly within the 2k spawn region where he built 4 lavacast structures. Warske's first lavacast build was a church inspired by Dominicanenkerk (Vienna)[https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominicanenkerk_%28Wenen%29](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominicanenkerk_%28Wenen%29), the second lavacast build was inspired by the hall of records of New-York, for the third he took inspiration of a typical American church and the fourth and was a recreation of a domed baroque church.

Today Warske is busy building his second major solo base, which he likes to call Gysdall II.

### Wingston
In the end of 2022 Warske founded his own base group called [Wingston](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Wingston). He had originally started this group with Dima788, but because Dima did not respect the rules himself, Warske decided to kick Dima and started the group all over again. It is a group that mainly builds bases close to spawn with each time a different view tower as the centrepiece for the city. Currently, 5 Wingston bases have been constructed. The group is still active as of today.

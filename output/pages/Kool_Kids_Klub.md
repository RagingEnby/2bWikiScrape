The **Kool Kids Klub** **(KKK)** was a base founded by [c1yd3i](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/c1yd3i) and [Rustle_League](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rustle_League). It was started as the two got bored from travelling as far as they could away from spawn. The base was famous for housing the largest gold farm at the time, outsizing even the one at [Aureus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Aureus).

## History
### Foundation
[C1yd3i](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/C1yd3i) and [Rustle_League](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rustle_League), when they first joined, wanted to get as far away from Spawn as they could. Eventually, they reached the millions by travelling on the Nether highway. At some point though, they got tired and have founded the base sometime in 2014. The two began working on the base and eventually began to slowly invite other players such as [James_Rustles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/James_Rustles), who arrived on November 25th, 2014, [SilverKrownKing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SilverKrownKing), [DocSmurf](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DocSmurf), and [Dr_Cash](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dr_Cash). James_Rustles eventually invited [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) to join the base. According to Fit, when he arrived, the base was really ugly. The group had large ambitions for the base and they eventually agreed to build the largest gold farm at the time. The base also had a mass underground railroad system. Fit also made a stained glass house.

### The Gold Farm
The obsidian for the farm itself was actually created using a limited time "bug" in Minecraft, which was exploited with a device called a "String Obsidian Generator". This device allowed for an obsidian block to be created out of a lava flowing block rather than a lava source block. While the blocks still needed to be mined and moved it allowed for the KKK to essentially "print" obsidian for use in the farm. This endeavor was mostly undertaken by SilverKrownKing. A donation was also made by [Kinorana](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kinorana) to speed up the process.

During the gold farm construction, the group decided to create a large pyramid around the farm. On December 20th, 2014, the base was completed and the portals for the farm were lit, which actually lagged the server. The server lagged so much when it was used, that [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) had to disable it. The base had a major issue, however, and that was its close proximity to the highway. This issue inevitably caused the base to meet its fate when someone happened upon the base by accident. The coordinates were then leaked to the public and the base was destroyed. This lead to the group taking as many god apples as they could and splitting to grander ventures, which was eventually [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria).

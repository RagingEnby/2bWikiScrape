}}**Teslic** was a building group in 2020.

## History
Teslic was founded in July 2020 under the name 'The Successful Republic' by [Brickfactory](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Brickfactory). The original members were Brickfactory, [Fineidos](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fineidos), [FLLMALL](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FLLMALL), [Soulbond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Soulbond), [Apollo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Apollo), and [Memoryz](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Memoryz). Many of the members were also part of the group [Insignia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Insignia), which was constantly insiding the Successful republic. After Fineidos helped Brickfactory clean the group up, the group was temporarily renamed to 'The Fraternity', after the [New Facepunch Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/New_Facepunch_Republic) member [GentlemanPHD's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/GentlemanPHD) group of the same name on another server. The group brought in a number of new members in August of 2020 such as [Benjamin_Gilbert](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Benjamin_Gilbert), [IAmCthulu](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IAmCthulu), [Spectre](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spectre), and [Ponkz](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ponkz). The group started a short-lived spawnbase in early Fall, before starting Tundrabase with the new members [KarsenMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KarsenMC) and [ElGooseMan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ElGooseMan). There they duped the group's main stash with the [Pyro dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Duplication_glitch). The group joined [Guardians of Andromeda](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardians_of_Andromeda) briefly when it started, although several members were later kicked for insiding. After the grief of GOA's first base, Proxima Centurai, the GOA members [TheDem1urge](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheDem1urge), [rpb7191](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/rpb7191), and [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) joined for a short period, before leaving (or getting kicked in SmackAttack86's case) when one of the Teslic members exposed a large public audience to the fact that [TheDem1urge](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheDem1urge) was in fact [SmackAttack86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SmackAttack86). Most active Teslic members participated in the [Tenth Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tenth_Incursion), and later in the Guardsmen event at [Camp Spooky](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Camp_Spooky). Teslic went inactive afterwards, with Brickfactory and Ponkz quitting, and Fineidos joining [Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys). Some members later participated in [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate) and [Linked Horizon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Linked_Horizon). There was a short-lived revival attempt in January 2021. Tundrabase was griefed in Spring 2021.

## Context
On October 16th, 2021, [postto](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/postto) established [Larptown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Larptown), a base intended to be used as a more secure base for the [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association), who wished for a base that lasted longer than the average [SBA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association) base, which typically did not last very long due to the bases' close proximity to Spawn. In early November, roughly 2 weeks after the base was established, a player named [MaxHolloway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MaxHolloway) discovered [Larptown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Larptown) whilst escaping [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn). He stole all materials from the base as well as [MrSourkiwi](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MrSourkiwi)'s history of the base entitled 'The Book of Larp'. One of the most notable materials that were stolen were the 4 shulker boxes of glazed terracotta that [postto](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/postto) passed the day before mining and smelting for a build he was planing to make. The theft of those materials in particular is where the conflict took its name from.

On December 14th, the [SBA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association) member [BigGreasyEgg](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BigGreasyEgg) discovered [Maxholloway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Maxholloway)'s solo base while base hunting. He relayed this information to [postto](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/postto) and the other [Larptown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Larptown) residents who then made plans to grief his base on December 24th as a Christmas event for the rest of the group. And so, as planned, [Durkaaqt](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Durkaaqt), [MrSourKiwi,](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MrSourKiwi) [Greggopants](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Greggopants), [Paulsteve007](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Paulsteve007) and [Rrdrock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rrdrock) went and griefed
[Maxholloway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Maxholloway)'s base as planned. As they arrived, they found among other things, the shulker boxes of glazed terracotta and the 'The Book of Larp' that were previously stolen. In a sentiment of larp reciprocity, the griefers world-downloaded and stole [MaxHolloway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MaxHolloway)'s base before spawning withers and lavacasting it. When they were about to leave, [MaxHolloway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MaxHolloway) logged in and caught the greifers red handed. Feeling bad about it, [Durkaaqt](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Durkaaqt) decided to teach [MaxHolloway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MaxHolloway) how to hide his base from base hunters, while also reiterating that any action taken against the [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association) would not be tolerated.

On December 26th, [MaxHolloway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MaxHolloway) leaked the Larptown coordinates to the [The Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Imperials) Highranks. [Lukent](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lukent) and [TreebranchMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TreebranchMC), followed by MaxHolloway who showed up late, arrived at Larptown and they griefed the base. Lukent even uploaded a recording of the grief to YouTube which has since been unlisted. This grief made the Spawn Builders furious and they responded by insiding Imperials and griefing as many bases as they could get their hands on. The number of griefed bases varies, as Former Imperials Highranks claim that around 6 bases were griefed, while SBA claims that 16 Imperials bases were griefed.

## The Conflict
[Postto](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Postto) and the [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association) declared war on [The Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Imperials) right after the grief of [Larptown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Larptown). The Imperials responded to the news by antagonizing SBA, daring them to take action and stating that SBA are spawn builders and not griefers.

The Spawn Builders, lead by postto and [Durkaaqt](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Durkaaqt), formulated a plan of attack that consisted of 3 main points for the first night:

*Grief an old Imperial mapart base that [Paulsteve007](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Paulsteve007) had found a couple months prior.
* Grief the Imperial highrank base that Durkaaqt had found by luck two days prior.
*Inside the Imperials.

Meanwhile, [postto](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/postto), accompanied by [Rrdrock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rrdrock), [MrSourKiwi](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MrSourKiwi), [DustLink](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DustLink) and [Greggopants](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Greggopants) went out and griefed the old Imperial mapart base. [Postto](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Postto) made a point to let him personally grief the old Imperials poster mapart and turned it into [SBA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SBA) propaganda, by blowing up controlled holes in it and building a penis shape in the mouth of the Imperial dragon. They also build the inscription "Larptown on top" upside down so that when the map art is rotated in an item frame, the inscription becomes readable. Once the grief was done, the members distributed the altered mapart at nether spawn.

While both griefs where taking place, SBA members [Ranlen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ranlen) and [CuppyK](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CuppyK) joined the Imperials discord server and communicated with lower ranking members who gave them the coordinates to a few of the Imperial recruit bases which were then sent back to the rest of the SBA members involved in the attack. [CuppyK](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CuppyK) created a fake SBA discord server called the "SBA recruitment discord". He then started advertising this fake server in the Imperial discord server promising that everyone that would leak Imperial coordinates would get invited into [SBA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SBA). A great number of Imperial lowranks jumped ship and leaked coordinates to Imperial bases in the fake discord server. Imperial leaders also joined the server during all of this and were able to view who had already/was planning to leak base coordinates, so Imperial leadership was able to start banning the traitors from Imperials. The leaked bases were all griefed in the following days including;

*~4 recruit bases
*An old Imperial stash
*Aqueous IV

Aqueous IV was self-griefed by [Slash_invis](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slash_invis), an ex-member of SBA that was kicked and and joined the Imperials. Later, postto found buried chests in which Slash_invis had previously tried to hide six dubs of TNT, totems and sugar cane.
## Aftermath
On January 3rd 2022, MaxHolloway griefed [SBA 19](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SBA_19) in revenge, but [The Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Imperials) made peace with [SBA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association) after this, and the war came to a close.

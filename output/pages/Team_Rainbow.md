**Team Rainbow** was a building group founded by [Brayin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Brayin) on August 11, 2017, after [Team Aurora](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Aurora) became increasingly inactive.

## Pre- History
Brayin and Da99thWolf started playing regularly on 2b2t around the same time and became friends over their YouTube channels where they would play around with the idea of making videos on "The Oldest Server in Minecraft." Eventually, Brayin made friends with [NedaT](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NedaT) and was invited to join [Team Aurora](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Aurora). Da99thWolf befriended a girl by the name of EmeraldGirlYT and moved her way into [the Peacekeepers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/the_Peacekeepers) originally to spy on them and give the coordinates to Aurora. On October 3, 2016, Da99thWolf brought [CancerChan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CancerChan) to [Nightingale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boz-wlEMVc0), where CancerChan destroyed it, making Brayin a little weary of Da99thWolf's intentions in their friendship. Eventually, they both moved up the social hierarchies of their respective teams and went their separate ways until the teams became dormant and the two rekindled their friendship.

Following the Fifth Incursion, the Peacekeepers became highly inactive and the [4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_4th_Reich) "disbanded" loosely, leaving Aurora as the only team left for several months until it too became inactive. Seeing as Aurora and the PK were allied with the Blind Eye Clan for a short period and that Da99thWolf had already had a friendship with Brayin in the past, they started a team together.

## History
Team Rainbow was a group founded by [Brayin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Brayin) on August 11, 2017, after [Team Aurora](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Aurora) became increasingly inactive as it increasingly shifted away from 2b2t to other projects (like an Aurora SMP).
The first two members to join were [Da99thWolf](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Da99thWolf) and [TheEnderBomber](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheEnderBomber) (both former members of [The Peacekeepers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Peacekeepers)) and it remained the three of them until December 17, 2017, when Brayin made a [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/7keii8/introducing_team_rainbow/?ref=share&ref_source=link) announcing that the group was recruiting new members.

In May of 2018, Team Rainbow had become one of the largest groups on 2b2t at the time, but activity in the group had declined throughout late 2019. They are responsible for many rainbow-themed builds that have been popping up in the greater spawn area.

Thus, Team Rainbow was born and TheEnderBomber was added to the crew (on August 11, 2017) along with some other players of the anarchy server. Two months later, in December of 2017, Brayin began to recruit new members for the team as 2b2t entered a quiet period. Originally, he wanted to do this with Aurora but did not want to do it without NedaT.

In January of 2018, a secondary banner was created for recruits of the team since interest in the group had increased by quite a lot. Team Rainbow began to hang out more at Ocelot Bay due to Brayin's obsession with cats. They were frequently there, repairing builds and taming the Ocelots that seemingly only spawn in that area.

April 3, 2018, brought a new wave of 2b2t players to the server and Team Rainbow began to scout out the best of the bunch to join the crew whilst simultaneously helping kill new players at spawn. This did not mean they were 100% against the incursion in any way but simply doing their own thing to benefit their group in the long run.

As the Summer of 2018 was approaching, Team Rainbow became more active around the spawn area and further bonded with the fellow group, [Infrared](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infrared). Brayin and Retronautx (leaders of Rainbow and Infrared respectively), decided that it would be a good idea to befriend newbies such as FloatTea, and became allies with her brand new group: Team Netherteas.

In the Fall of 2018, Team Rainbow founded a new base called Rainbow Forest, where they invited active players such as McButcher, who had randomly shown up and started building in the New Rainbow Islands. The base was found and griefed by Nambrose in July of 2019. The most active Team Rainbow members have moved on to new projects and the group as a whole has been very quiet since then.

## Team Aurora
[Team Aurora](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Aurora) was originally the only group for Brayin and NedaT. Aurora is still looking for chill people to accept into the group. Team Rainbow can be classified as an extension of Team Aurora, seeing as if they see fit, a Rainbow member can be promoted to Aurora status. With this being said, Rainbow is also very much responsible for its actions.

## Relations
*[Team Aurora](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Aurora) - A team formed by NedaT which Brayin is a part of, despite the inactivity.
*[The Peacekeepers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Peacekeepers) - A team formed by PandaSauceYT. It is unknown the current status of Da99thWolf in the team although at one point she was co-owner alongside EmeraldGirlYT when PandaSauceYT quit 2b2t for some time. As of April of 2018, Peacekeepers are friendly with Team Rainbow!
*[The Blind Eye Clan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Blind_Eye_Clan) (formerly Ragnarok) - Brayin and Da99thWolf were both involved with the Triple Treaty (TTT). In December of 2017, Flip began to show his support to Team Rainbow.
*[The 4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_4th_Reich) - iTavux helped to make Brayin and NedaT better friends, which lead to Brayin joining Aurora. The 4th Reich would periodically meme Brayin and Da99thWolf at one point in time because they did not take them for serious players.
*[The Vortex Coalition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Vortex_Coalition) - Since the two groups haven't interacted with each other, it is safe to say they are neutral with each other.
*[Highland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highland) - NedaT has introduced Brayin to the members of Highland and they appear to be neutral to Team Rainbow
*[Inferno](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infrared) - Since December 20, 2017, Team Rainbow had been officially allied with Team Inferno.
*The Menders - The group of [R2bEEaton](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/R2bEEaton) is allied with Team Rainbow.
*[Trojan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Trojan) - Enemies due to an alliance with Infrared.

## Trivia
*Contrary to popular belief, Team Rainbow is a proud supporter of the LGBT community, although members may do what they wish with their personal lives. The team name also comes from the peacefulness that the Rainbow represents without being peaceful at all times (ex. the Hurricane BEFORE the Rainbow).
*The team is an open group, but is in fact open to accepting new players regardless of their background (ex. an enemy to Aurora or PK may or may not be eligible for acceptance into Team Rainbow).
*The recipe for the Team Rainbow banner can be found [here](https://www.needcoolshoes.com/banner?=labEmLffkwaiaB).
*There is a secondary Team Rainbow banner, designed for elite, higher class members. That can be found [here](https://www.needcoolshoes.com/banner?=labEmLffkwpipB)

**Javikia** is a builder, base hunter, and one of the leaders of DonFuer.

## Joining 2b2t
Javikia joined 2b2t after he watched one of [AntVenom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AntVenom)'s videos about the server. He played for 3 months, built his base, Nutshell, then quit until September 2022. When he came back he joined the [Sun Knights](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sun_Knights) after he found their mapart on the highway.

## Sun Knights
When Javikia joined the Sun Knights, he built at recruit bases 21-24. He ranked up during this time and eventually gained Lord of Cinder rank. Due to the Sun Knights' group inactivity, he chose to go build with [Saturn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Saturn) which lead him to being kicked from the group. In May 2024, Javikia reached out to [CuppyK](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CuppyK) about the potential of running the Sun Knights. He was given the top rank in the group and started recruit bases 27 and 28 until eventually becoming inactive and being removed from the position.

## Graybeard Geezers
Javikia heard about a public base, and after using the link in [Sun Knights](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sun_Knights) chat, he joined the Geezers and built at [Geezer Town 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Geezer_Town_2). He later was a builder at [Geezer Town 5](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Geezer_Town_5) and 6, taking a 2 month break and returning to build at [Geezer Town Seven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Geezer_Town_Seven). He prioritized building with the Geezers until joining [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer). However, to this day Javikia is still affiliated with the Graybeard Geezers, building at their bases.

## DonFuer
In March 2024, [Max1mumChr1s](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Max1mumChr1s) reached out to Javikia about being a guest at [Red Castle](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Red_Castle). After building extensively at Red Castle, he was promoted to scout. After this, he was invited to [Don Chyku](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Don_Chyku) and continued building and ranking up. In VC at a [Gatekeepers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Gatekeepers) meeting, [Rainbowren11](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rainbowren11) was screensharing in Discord and accidentally leaked [DonFuer 28](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_28) to Javikia and a few others. Due to this, they were all invited to the base. In July 2024, following the grief of DonFuer 28, he was promoted to leadership. After this, he started bases such as [Arendal](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Arendal) and [New Arendal](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/New_Arendal) until, in December 2024, he was promoted to Elder.

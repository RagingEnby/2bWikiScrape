**xsupergo08** (aka **Troppy** or **Tropical_Becfest**) is a builder, griefer and pvper on 2b2t.

## 2020
xsupergo08 joined the server in 2018, but did not play consistently until he rejoined on July 30th, 2020, where he was primarily interested in exploring. After rejoining the server, he founded the group [The Beginning](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Beginning). He travelled back to spawn, where he recruited 2 [Infinity Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinity_Incursion) members, [Aleck](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Aleck) and [cgam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/cgam) to his new group. He continued exploring the server, travelling to the ruins of [Space Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_Valkyria), where he discovered an unknown group of players rebuilding it in secret. He went on to join [MilkMen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MilkMen), a branch of [Milk Maids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Milk_Maids), and continue building with them until the downfall of the group in late November.

## 2021
In 2021, he quit 2b2t and went to a server called 2beta2t and became a "Known" player on that server. He returned to the server in late November after a falling out on 2beta2t, joining many random groups he didn't care to remember. xsupergo08 stayed at a then abandoned duo base from his good friend [stegosaurusdd](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/stegosaurusdd), were he would build until January of 2022.

## 2022
At the beginning of 2022, xsupergo08, now going by the name: Troppy, began to focus on integrating himself into the wider community.  Troppy joined [Donfuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer), where he was a prominent member of the group and befriended many other players. He trolled within the group for some time with [EXM1LITARY](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/EXM1LITARY), until EXM1LITARY was caught leaking coordinates of bases to the [Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys). After this, [EXM1LITARY](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/EXM1LITARY) founded the group, [CakeMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CakeMasons) with a player named [Kizzycocoa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kizzycocoa). Troppy befriended Kizzy and became a member of CakeMasons as well.
While that scandal was happening he joined the [Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperials) where he met a player called [FU3X](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FU3X), who became a close friend of his. In April of 2022, FU3X invited Troppy, alongside their mutual friend, [ninjapandarocker](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ninjapandarocker), and another member of the Imperials, [Max_Rockatasky](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Max_Rockatasky), to form a group called [Kuklos](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kuklos). This group was intended to be a Nazi LARP group. He participated in many Nazi-related activities until he made his home at [Vril Town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vril_Town), the main base of [Vril Society](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vril_Society).
In November 2022, he participated in a largescale PvP fight between the [Southern Canal Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Southern_Canal_Association) and the [Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column). Following this, xsupergo08 became inactive on the server again, going back to stay at Vril Town.

## 2023
On February 7th, he returned to [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) to see he had been banned from [Donfuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer) due to his inactivity, and close affiliation to Kizzycocoa. During this time, he considered [Donfuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer) to be his main group. After being banned, he became more active in the [Cakemasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cakemasons).
In April 2023, there was a bounty placed on the player, [Dima788](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dima788). Troppy and [pixelati0n](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/pixelati0n), a close friend at the time, attempted to set a trap for Dima788 at the base, [The Invisible Castle](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Invisible_Castle), which was the longest known base on 2b2t up until that point. The trap did not go to plan, which then lead to the base being griefed.

Later that summer, while looking for griefing partners and allies, he joined [The Teutonic Order](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Teutonic_Order), a known griefing group on the server. They went on to grief [Don Maximus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Don_Maximus), [The Dark Mirror](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Dark_Mirror), and multiple other bases.

Today, Troppy continues to be an active member of the PvP and griefing communities.

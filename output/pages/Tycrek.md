{{lowercase title}}

**tycrek** is a developer, digger, and notable player on 2b2t. She is partly responsible for one of the largest projects in survival Minecraft, and is the co-founder and developer of ttRMS.

## History
tycrek learned about 2b2t in March 2020 through someone's signature on an old forum post about 2b2t. Around the same time, the COVID-19 pandemic started to have a global impact and quarantine started, leading to tycrek becoming extremely bored. Being extremely bored, she decided to try it out and immediately got hooked. Once she joined 2b2t, she escaped spawn fairly easily and wandered around within 150K blocks of spawn with no real goal. Eventually, she started travelling up the +x -z highway where she met ThunderStorm_12, who gave him a few basic survival kits, one of which contained his first elytra on the server. They travelled up the +x -z for a bit, once in a while going through nether portals but not finding much. Just past 1M on the +x -z they found an unfinished build and a small stash, which they raided and then griefed. The items from that stash supplied him for most of his first year on 2b2t. In early June 2020, tycrek went back to spawn, then partway back up the +x -z to build his first spawn base, Gezellig (meaning "tiny hole"). She has intermittently checked up on this and the last time she checked it was still standing, over a year later. She continued up the +x -z and built another base with CementedWall101, as well as some smaller outposts including a tiny woodland campground.

## Motorway Extension Gurus and highway work
On July 7th, while again, travelling up the +x -z, she ran into 187K187K which was one of illville502's alternate accounts. illville told tycrek about the [Motorway Extension Gurus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Motorway_Extension_Gurus), and tycrek expressed interest in joining the group. tycrek's first task was loading illville's ender pearls so she could move the group's stash further up the highway to supply the dig. After that, she was given access to MEG's digging bot, and became an official member of MEG. tycrek is also a part of the Gold Mesa Consortium "Core". Gold Mesa has built various outposts on the server to serve as supply stations for highway groups including MEG and the [Highway Workers Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Workers_Union). This group was very active during the 2020 donkey [Dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dupe), but is now mostly inactive as of June 2021. Some projects tycrek has participated in as a part of MEG are:

* 3x3 dig for the +x -z and -x +z nether highways
* 6x4 dig for Leg 6 of the World Border Ring Road
* Discovered [ufocrossing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ufocrossing)'s shop stash which supplied many MEG projects
* Made the official MEG website
* Helped make the Traveller bot which MEG uses to track their Digger's Netherrack Mined counts

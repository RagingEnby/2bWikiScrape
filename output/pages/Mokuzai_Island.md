**Mokuzai Island** was an island spawn base by [Prismary](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Prismary) to which he invited new friends of his.
## History
On May 9, 2018, Prismary founded Mokuzai Island near Spawn as a vanilla base to which he invited new friends of his. The name "Mokuzai" means 'Wook' in Japanese, and referred to the forest on the island. After being made aware of an [Indestructible End Crystal](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Indestructible_End_Crystals) in late August, he moved it to the base with the help of Aryezz, which included stealing it back from other players as several other players raced to take it. After [l_amp](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/l_amp) found Mokuzai Island while performing the [100k Mapping Project](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/100k_Mapping_Project) in late 2018, he used the then-private [Chunk dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chunk_dupe) to duplicate the Indestructible End Crystal there several times, with crystals from there being used as late 2020 with l_amp's 'Pyrobyte Resummoning Experiment' [Spawnmason lodge](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons). Mokuzai Island burned down on January 7, 2019, before being rebuilt February 14, 2019. It survived most of the year before being totally griefed by an unknown player and abandoned by its inhabitants on September 14, 2019.

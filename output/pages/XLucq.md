**xLucq** was a high-ranking member of [The Mew Revolution](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mew_Revolution) who played in 2021 and 2022.
## History
xLucq joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) on March 3th 2021. On his first day on the server, he met [Sushee](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sushee) who helped him escape spawn and joined [Edna](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Edna) (Led by [J09](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/J09)) with him. Sushee and xLucq were added to the group's main base, which was called [Base Edna](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Base_Edna). After spending some time there, xLucq and Sushee felt that the leader didn't care about the group's members, and so xLucq and Sushee proceeded to destroy the base, causing [Edna](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Edna) to disband. After the disbandment of Edna, xLucq and Sushee tried to join [Mew Revolution](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mew_Revolution) together. Only xLucq was added, however, causing their friendship to suffer. xLucq moved to Mew Revolution and spent all the remainder of his time there, never joining another group. He worked his way up in Mew's ranks, before ending off in the group's inner circle rank at the time of its disbandment. He also ran a base for the group called "Cats Heaven" (which then lasted about three months), and helped to process orders for the group's short-lived shop. xLucq quit 2b2t not long after the disband of [Mew Revolution](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mew_Revolution).

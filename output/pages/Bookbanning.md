**Bookbanning** is the act of effectively banning a player by giving them a shulker full of books, each book having maxed-out characters, or a large amount of characters. When opened, it will overflow the [packet](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Network_packet)'s data, and if the packets are too large, the victim will be disconnected. It is impossible to reconnect without disconnecting immediately after. Ban books are often renamed to other items to trick players.

## History
Bookbanning was first discovered by [Jumbo_Warrior](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jumbo_Warrior) in early 2017 after he collected almost a full enderchest of shulker boxes of books. It was then used on [thesheergenius](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/thesheergenius), and then popularized by [Prismary](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Prismary). It was later further popularized by [cityboss1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/cityboss1).

[Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) stated in early June 2019 that bookbanning would be fixed and that anyone who is book banned can reconnect again.

Bookbanning was used by [The Book Club](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Book_Club) to book ban over 400 newfags in October 2019 using "gas chambers" which had the same design as trapped nether portals, except they had dispensers that dispensed book ban shulkers to the new players, instantly updating their inventory to ban them.

It was also possible to kick players back into the queue when killing them by shooting a bow while having a bookban in the offhand. It was also possible to kick every player off the server when killing them using a ban book. [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) would later disable death messages as a temporary fix. Death messages were disabled for a while.

Bookbanning was patched by [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster), but it took away the functionality of .peek and preview, popular hacks that allowed you to see the contents of a shulker box without opening it.

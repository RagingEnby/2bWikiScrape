## History
Armorsmith joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) in June 2016. He wasn't active for almost a year due to the long queue and made wooden huts. He re-joined in the middle of 2017 with the simple goal of calling attention to himself. And so he did, by building [lag machines](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/lag_machines). His first lag machine was called "The Valley of Signs", due to the many signs placed due to AutoSign. The lag machine was later destroyed. He went on to build a second one, Carolina. This lag machine used a method by 2F4U and was built at a time when Hausemaster didn't care much about these builds. Armorsmith would use this lag machine for months, making him hated by almost every player on 2b2t as it would crash the server and bring TPS down to 0.5 or less.

When his lag machine got deleted by Hause, Armorsmith decided to become the first player to ever see the world border at the [End](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_End), and so he went on a journey that lasted an entire week. When he arrived there, he built a base at the End world border corner - [Armorland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/List_of_small_bases#Armorland). Armorsmith would later work on other lag machines and other bases, collecting rare items such as the signs left by [ElRichMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ElRichMC) and griefing bases and public infrastructure such as highways and [map art](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/map_art) outposts (the maps were used to create his two museums). One of the highways he griefed was the [Old Spawn Road](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Old_Spawn_Road). At its beginning, he built a structure called the Wrath of Armorsmith, referencing [Wrath Outpost](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Wrath_Outpost).

### Cult Foundation
, and his trademark Hammer And Sickle.]]
Armorsmith would declare himself as a "god", and create a meme "cult" [group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith%E2%80%99s_Followers) with hundreds of members, some of which grew to become significant players of the 2b2t community, such as HaxxorElite, Retronaut, quj, Mc_Ren, RusherFag and many others. He was the first player to establish a cult of personality on 2b2t around himself, inspiring others such as Lowdown69 and Solour68, a trend that would later be criticized by [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86). The group is based on worshipping him as a god and spreading his trademark hammer and sickle logo. This group was responsible for some unique creations such as the first [Spawn Sky Symbol](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Sky_Symbols) and a large project dedicated to spreading FPS lagging (early form of [chunk banning](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chunkban)) in several places on the server. They also built bases such as the MOTD palace, [Space 2k2k](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_2k2k), The [Valley of Armorsmith](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valley_of_Armorsmith), and other locations. One of the most famous members of the group is the YouTuber [Big Man Tyrone](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Big_Man_Tyrone), who has over 500,000 subscribers and makes regular propaganda content for Armorsmith. Their Discord server is one of the largest on the entire server with thousands of members.

As a group leader, Armorsmith was involved in many community events and changes. He fought against the [6th Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/6th_Incursion) and heavily damaged its wall with his group. During his fight with the Incursion he defeated [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) and caused him to combat log. He also attacked [ThebesAndSound](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ThebesAndSound)'s trench crew in the [7th Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/7th_Incursion) preventing the lava wall from being constructed. Some of his projects, such as the Facepunch Republic's revival with [chezhead](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/chezhead) and the "[8th Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Eighth_Incursion)" with [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013), eventually led to the creation of the [New Facepunch Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/New_Facepunch_Republic_(2019)) and the [Infinity Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinity_Incursion), respectively. Armorsmith's Followers is also responsible for the [Anti Bedrock Society](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Anti_Bedrock_Society), which deleted the last bedrock blocks at the Bedrock Comet at [ZiggyBase](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ZiggyBase) after winning the Battle Of Ziggy Town against the Klansmen along with [Team WAO](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_WAO). In December 2020 Armorsmith defeated kingoros in a duel. Armorsmith was also responsible for the griefing of the [Autumn Drain](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Autumn_Drain) in December 2020. In 2021 Armorsmith participated in the building of the Unnamed Base by his group, and he later revived the Anti Bedrock Society with the purpose of removing more illegally placed blocks. He was also the leader of Operation Black Hole, a method to priority strip new players from the [queue](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/queue) of the server, which ended up in his account being [punished](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Punishments) and priority banned from the 2b2t store.

### YouTube Content
Armorsmith is actively working on making 2b2t go viral on YouTube. He works together with Big Man Tyrone to produce meme videos about the server. He is also known among many Israeli players, as he was the one who brought 2b2t to Israel, by working with Israeli content creators TopStrix (113,000 Subscribers), Tell0 (50,000 Subscribers), and Gal Cohen (122,000 Subscribers). Some of them made entire playlists on the server under his creative assistance, causing queue numbers to increase. He is also indirectly responsible for making 2b2t go viral in Russia, thanks to Russian-Israelis who watched videos he made and shared them with Russian YouTubers. Recently he began collaborating with Russian YouTubers as well. His actions probably contributed to the current length of the server's queue in addition to other large content creators such as [SalC1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SalC1) and FitMC.

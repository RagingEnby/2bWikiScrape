The Anti Watercube Coalition, was formed to combat the [Infinity Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinity_Incursion). The Anti-Incursion was founded by [c0mmie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/c0mmie), [gh_joey](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/gh_joey), [8nothing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/8nothing), and [maksitaxi](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/maksitaxi), who over the past year had become enemies with the Infinity Incursion due to various drama that had taken place. The group utilized large obsidian clogs in the watercubes path to prevent creation of watersources, the most effective being Obby Casts - large lava casts that were covered in obsidian.

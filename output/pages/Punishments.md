**Player punishments** refer to a variety of actions taken by [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) against players such as priority stripping/banning. Though originally rare, they have become much more common in recent years. In extreme cases such as game-breaking lag exploits or crash exploits, the admins of 2b2t have been known to take action on players by removing their priority queue, kicking them, reverting their illegals, reverting their bases, and in rare cases, fully banning their accounts (unconfirmed). The Discord group 2builders12rules is dedicated to keeping track of all punished players. Recently, plugins were installed to instantly priority strip players who were standing in chunks that were crashing the server.

## Types
The following are 2b2t's punishments as laid out by 2builders12rules.

*Mute (soft mute) – unable to send chat messages
*PM mute – unable to send private messages
*Hard mute – both soft mute and PM mute
*Prio strip – priority queue is removed
*Prio ban – priority queue is removed and you are unable to rebuy
*Blacklist – all blacklisted accounts that are online are kicked in waves
*IP ban – any accounts logged into will be priority banned, hard muted, and added to the blacklist
*Bed ban – unable to use a bed to set as a respawn point

## By year
### 2012
[Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) removed [End portal](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/End_portal)s created via a backdoor, and eventually reset the entire End dimension. He also removed duped [Dragon Eggs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Dragon_Egg) and Endstone in the overworld.

### 2014
[Victor96](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Victor96) was muted for arguing with Hausemaster about the functionality of a chat filter.

### 2015
Hausemaster muted some people, like [James_Rustles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/James_Rustles), as a joke, and called them "Chinese Bots". These mutes went on for a few hours and were simply a joke.

### 2016
In late 2016, torogadude's veteran queue status was manually removed by TheCampingRusher and Curtis because torogadude had hacked a friend of Rusher and posted a video of logging into their account and bedtrapping them. This caused extreme outrage throughout the community, starting the #freetoro movement. Following the backlash, torogadude's veteran queue access was given back and Rusher explained what had happened in a video.

### 2017
Throughout early 2017, powerful lag machines were used frequently to drop TPS. At the time Hausemaster was relatively inactive so no action was taken and the machines were used for months without being removed. In July, Hausemaster started to take action by deleting the lag machines used by [Armorsmith](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith) and [househousehouse1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/househousehouse1). Later in 2017, [Gr1f](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Gr1f)'s (another powerful lagger) veteran queue access was removed, but unlike the torogadude incident, this didn't cause as much community outrage because players were annoyed by the lag and thought it was justified.

### 2019
As of 2019, the admins of 2b2t punish players who intentionally lag or crash the server by removing their priority queue and banning them from the donate.2b2t.org priority queue store. Many accounts have been banned then unbanned in the past, such as those involved in the mass ban on Halloween 2019 caused by [The Book Club](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Book_Club).

On November 26, 2019, every player on the priority ban list was cleared except 0x22, Paralusion2, and DqwnSyndrome.

On December 6, 2019, a device was made near spawn by the [Brownmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Brownmen) that automatically priority banned anyone who went near it. the_wise_walrus was the first player to get banned using this tactic but has since been unbanned.

### 2020
Hausemaster begins temporarily muting spammers in chat who promote or advertise discord server or just spam.

Hausemaster has been banning people from shop.2b2t.org. Hausemaster has banned many people who were making lag machines. Many of these people were members of the NSN (No Server November) group.

### 2021
, all of these accounts were banned from purchasing [priority queue](https://donate.2b2t.org) on September 2021.]]
In 2021, a new sort of mute became much more common, where the ability to whisper or /msg individual players in chat is totally removed in addition. This punishment is known as whisper mute or hard mute. It is almost always combined with a standard global chat chat mute. A hard mute  makes the player unable to communicate with others through game chat in any capacity.
These hard mutes tend to be handed to individuals who spread doxes or other related materials.

Priority queue bans are also often handed out, with many effected players alleging their innocence.

Priority queue banned players also now tend to be "IP Prio Banned", meaning any additional accounts that log in through that ip are also priority queue banned.

In September, the group [Armorsmith's Followers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith%27s_Followers) began a campaign named Operation Black Hole, which abused the plugin that auto stripped players from priority queue access who were standing near powerful [lag machines](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/lag_machines). They designed a structure made with over 100,000 sand blocks above signs and cobwebs, which they refered to as a Black Hole due to the similar effect of being unable to escape it whenever somebody stood too close. When they broke the central sign, the sand fell down to the cobwebs which caused a huge amount of lag that instantly dropped the [TPS](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TPS) down to 0. They would build these machines and convince new players to travel to them. Using this method, the players who reached the so called event horizon of the [chunkban](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/chunkban) would instantly freeze and become invincible to damage, receive 0 FPS on the server, and eventually have his account kicked while crashing 2b2t making his account priority queue stripped.

Eventually [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) discovered the players who were behind Operation Black Hole, and banned the main accounts of [Armorsmith](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith), Pockyboi, cumermen and NoComExploit from donating for priority queue on the 2b2t website.

### 2022
A record amount of players had their priority queue stripped and banned in 2022, notable players include [AnimeTiddie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AnimeTiddie), [Forceken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Forceken), and [Franknificant](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Franknificant). As of December 7th, 2022, more than 500 accounts are prio banned, mostly for no reason at all. [2b2t Times](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Times), a newspaper mapart run by ForceKen, was also forced to shut down, after ForceKen found both of his accounts priority banned, after an article surrounding the **Rules of 2b2t.** Another ban wave occurred, when in April 2022, many spawnfags found their priority queue stripped, after a controversy over a PvPer doxxing another PvPer. Over 40 players were banned in the incident, causing outrage in the community.

Eventually a new discord was formed called **2builders12rules**, to track the amount of players priority banned, stripped, muted, and blacklisted. Many players reported being priority stripped, muted, and banned for seemingly no reason, although it should be made known that some of the players were indeed lagging the server or spamming in chat.

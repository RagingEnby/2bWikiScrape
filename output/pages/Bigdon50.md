**bigdon50** was a former [midfag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/midfag) (or [oldfag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/oldfag), exact join date is disputed) on the server before fading into obscurity and leaving. His most notorious act was being behind the leaking and eventual destruction of the base [Summermelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Summermelon), as well as being affiliated with [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit).

## History
### Origins
It is unknown when bigdon joined 2b2t, but he had to have joined in early December 2013 or earlier, as he is seen talking in chat in a video of [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan) blowing up [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob)'s end base.

Bigdon didn't do anything of significance throughout his early days on the server. That was until after the Rusher War, when he built Jericho City. At some point during this time he became friends with Fit, getting some clout and recognition as a result.

### Infamy
After the grief of Jericho, bigdon50 would move to Summermelon and would also base at [Rocket Town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rocket_Town) with Fit. After Rocket Town was griefed, bigdon50 leaked the coordinates of Summermelon to Fit for unknown reasons, but most likely for clout or "revenge" after the grief of Rocket Town.

### Final Days
His last base would be The Citadel, which would later be abandoned, as according to Fit "He has become a Nomad like myself". Fit would make a video on The Citadel and would give bigdon50 a shout-out for all of his achievements on 2b2t. After the release of the video, bigdon faded into obscurity and has most likely quit 2b2t for good.

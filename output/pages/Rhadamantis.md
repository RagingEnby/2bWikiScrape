}}**Rhadamantis**, originally named **Kyriath** but also known as the **Lost City**, was the last major base built before the Second Incursion in the summer of 2013. It gained the title of "Lost City" due to the fact that not many players know of or have been to the base.

## History
Rhadamantis was built by SAINTEIRIK, Lordloffar, Bigmero, Bisquette, pheno778, and others. Not much was known about this group, except the fact that they were an independent group that existed in 2013. The base was then abandoned by the group for unknown reasons and was left to time. Eventually, people began to stumble upon the base and minor damage was dealt to the base, including a grief by zexesl2 on May 8th, 2013.
### Valkyria Annex
After the grief of [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria) by [Drewbookman](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Drewbookman) cut the [First Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/First_Incursion) short, the group moved to a base called Belegost. Soon after, a friend of [Coldwave](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coldwave) tried out Adolf Client - a client made by [X0XP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/X0XP) which was known to be backdoored. Much of the group scattered afterwards. On the quest for new grounds, [Pyrobyte](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pyrobyte) and [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86) stumbled upon and claimed for [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria). By the time it was discovered, many wooden buildings were burnt down, the inner palace wasn't finished, and its halls were made of dirt and stone despite its outward appearance. They fixed several buildings in the base and erected the signature Valkyrian Eagle on the main building. This base was also where the players Fubster and thePOMPANO would join Valkyria. Eventually, they left the base as well and it was once again left to the tides of anarchy. Once again, people began stumbling upon the base and they either admired it or inflicted minor damage but never settled. Over the many years since it had been formally uninhabited, it had surprisingly only sustained a relatively small amount of damage, considering the build is on an anarchy server. In early 2020, however, it was heavily griefed by c0mmie.
## Sign House
Near the town square, Rhadamantis hosts a small shack made of mainly oak wood with a brick top while spruce wood was used to repair the walls. It has two dandelions inside flower pots, one next to an oak tree. There is some fencing next to the house. Inside are many, many signs with no clear purpose or meaning. It is obvious that these signs are not original as some are on the spruce wood. Some include:
* HOW DO I MAKE BREAD? I'M SO HUNGRY TODAY.
* WILL YOU PLEASE GET ME A COW FOR CHRISTMAS?
* THE LION'S WORLD IS COLD, AND SHARP, AND FIERCE!
* PUNISH ME WITH BRUTALITY; MAKE ME FEEL LIKE A BIG BABY!
* DADDY, DADDY! WHAT IS HEAVEN LIKE?
* FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS UNTIL THE BEGIN TO REVERSE...
* WHY DO WE HAVE TO EAT POPCORN SANDWICHES TONIGHT?
* THAT MEANS YOU HAVE MENTAL STABILITY ISSUES. I DON'T DENY IT.
* NOW I HEAR THE LAUGHTER, FOREVER AND EVER...

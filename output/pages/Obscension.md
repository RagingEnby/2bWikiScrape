**Obscension** is a group on 2b2t known for hosting large public events, most notably [Pitfight](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pitfight).

## History
### Pre-Group
The original Obscension base pre-dates the founding of the group by a little over a year. Founded by [AnimeTiddie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AnimeTiddie) in February 2020, the base started as an area for him to learn Java Minecraft. In January 2021, [AnimeTiddie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AnimeTiddie) started construction of the central obsidian structure by placing buckets of lava from the nether into shaped water streams. Construction continued this way, slowly building upwards until March 2021, when [AnimeTiddie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AnimeTiddie) would made his first friend on the server, [FreeLees](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FreeLees). With only two thirds of the obsidian tower complete, FreeLees brought echests to mine and finish the tower. As the tower neared completion [AnimeTiddie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AnimeTiddie) started calling it "Obsidian Ascension", this was later shortened to "Obscension". A Mapart was constructed with the groups motto "Peace is the Way"

### Early Obscension
Very quickly Obscension gained 2 more members, [Svenn_Svenn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Svenn_Svenn) and [Hasuemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hasuemaster). Obscension also had a sister-group "The Untitled Goose Gang" that came to stay at the base. Together, they made a few builds such as locating stashes, constructing an large pearl loading complex, building a massive obsidian archer at spawn, and befriending other groups on the server. One of these early groups was [Mew Revolution](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mew_Revolution). In May of 2021, Mew Revolution invited Obscension to partner on a [Fight Club](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fight_Club) type event, where naked players would fist fight until their totems popped. The event was griefed after only 1 fight, although [SyndicateNA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SyndicateNA), was present at the event and he quickly killed the griefers. This event and first hand interaction with end crystal combat gave [AnimeTiddie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AnimeTiddie) the idea to start a new event, [Pitfight](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pitfight).

### The Fall of Obscension Base
Shortly after the Success of the Early PitFight events, the at-the-time co-leader of Obscension, FreeLees, joined [Team Rocket](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Rocket) in griefing [Chunk Haven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chunk_Haven) and a spawn meeting place. As a result of the griefs, a 'hitlist' was made using [Nocom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nocom) coordinates of all involved with the grief, including FreeLees. Obscension base was griefed later that week. Shortly after, the group decided to shift their main focus to the [Pitfight](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pitfight) events. However, construction of a new base, Boletus, begsn in the summer of 2021. The group gained another valuable member and friend, [Mindhax](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mindhax), who owned a large kit shop.

### Boletus and PitFight
[AnimeTiddie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AnimeTiddie) was the primary builder at Boletus, building a large system of clouds connected with golden stairways. There were plans to build greek style buildings on all of the clouds, but the base was griefed after only a couple clouds were finished. After the greif of Boletus, Obscension became entirely focused on PitFight. The group also gained another valuable member around this time, [Bigokewang](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bigokewang), who began sponsoring the PitFight events with 100 US dollars for every event. This allowed PitFight to start offering huge prizes to the winners of the event, drawing msny more attendees. Around this time Obscension took
inspiration from [Forceken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Forceken)'s 2b2t times,  and begin their own map campaigns for the PitFight events. A system was created within the group to build, reset, and distribute maparts around spawn that directed other players to the PitFight discord server and event. With this new mapart system PitFight grew exponentially. Through this mapart system, Obscension gained two more members, [Zero18485](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Zero18485) and [Fresh_herbs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fresh_herbs).

### The Year of PitFight and Heimsland
From March 2021 to March 2022, PitFight was a monthly event on 2b2t, completing the groups goal of hosting a year long event. During the last few months of PitFight, Bigokewang invited [AnimeTiddie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AnimeTiddie) to his base and together they built Heimsland. This base featured a large castle and Ice spire built by [AnimeTiddie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AnimeTiddie), as well as a sky temple and ice-themed End City constructed by Bigokewang. The base was also visited by many other Obscension members. Heimsland was discovered by a new player on the same day as PitFight 12, two hours before the event. Bigokewang killed the new player who, on death, dropped a full inventory of TNT. Because of this, all the members at the base decided to self grief. The destruction of Heimsland was completed only 30 minutes before the start of PitFight 12. PitFight 12 was the groups largest event, bringing in 107 players in two hours.

### Group Burnout and PitFight 13
Following PitFight 12 and the greifing of Heimsland, many of the group members took extended breaks from 2b2t, and a few quit entirely. Around this same time [AnimeTiddie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AnimeTiddie) would have all of his accounts prio-banned. The group entered a period of inactivity for 3 months. After this time, the group started planning another event- PitFight 13. In addition to AnimeTiddie's accounts being unbanned from purchasing priority queue, this revived the group and most of the members have since returned.

### PitFight 14
As of PitFight 14, most of Obscension no longer plays on 2b2t. The few members who still play the server have joined other groups, however, the group still unites occasionally to put on the [pitfight](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/pitfight) event for the community.

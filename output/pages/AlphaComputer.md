**AlphaComputer** is a griefer and collector of rare items, as well as a long-term friend of [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa). He was responsible for the resurgence of [32k swords](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hacked_Items) in 2018. He is also a past member of the [Spawnmasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons) (having been kicked from the group after drama surrounding the [Summermelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Summermelon) grief), and a current member of the [Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column). He was also the subject of a long-running meme concerning him running for president.
## History
### Summermelon Grief & Expulsion from The Spawnmasons
Following [ChromeCrusher's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ChromeCrusher) grief of [Fitlantis](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fitlantis), [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) established [Rocket Town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rocket_Town) on March 3, 2017. AlphaComputer was invited to the base. After it was griefed by [jddinger](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jddinger). AlphaComputer assisted in a grief of [Summermelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Summermelon) with Fit and others in May that was cited as a revenge grief, although jddinger was not a member of the base. A vote in the Spawnmasons was subsequently held that saw AlphaComputer (and nearly Fit) being removed from the group as a result of drama partially stemming from the grief. This ultimately resulted in [HermeticLock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HermeticLock) removing all members from the Spawnmasons, and publicly announcing a disbandment of the group. This ended the so-called [First Degree](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons#First_Degree) of the group.

### Revival of 32k weapons
In 2018, AlphaComputer discovered the hopper method for handling 32k swords. It consisted of avoiding anti-illegals plugins that reverted items by placing a shulker box containing 32k's on top of a hopper, and then placing the sword in the users hotbar with kill aura enabled. This method for moving 32k swords and his duping of them caused a resurgence of 32k's in late 2018 and 2019. It led to widespread use of the 'Alpha's 32k Sword's, and resulted in a complete re-shuffling of the PvP meta on the server as [Auto32k PvP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Combat#Superweapons_(32Ks)) became the norm throughout late 2018 and most of 2019.

**ZippieDooDah** is a builder, most notable for his membership in the [Spawnmasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons) and his former membership of [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium).
## History
ZippieDooDah joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) in May 2016. As [TheCampingRusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) joined right after, Zippie was unable to properly establish himself and resumed playing in 2017. Upon his return, he created a short-lived starter base with [KL200](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KL200). He met [jordanl666](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jordanl666) shortly thereafter on the highway and started a base with him. Zippie went inactive for a year, and then became a member of [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium) when he returned. He participated in a variety of bases in Emperium such as [Larry Land](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium#Larry_Land), [Empire's Edge 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium#Empire%27s_Edge_2), and [Propaganda Island](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium#Propaganda_Island). Zippie and jordanl666 found [AlphaComputer's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlphaComputer) stash, giving them stacked  [32K Weapons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/32K_Weapons). Together they started the JZ (for Jordan and Zippie) shop, which became one of the largest on the server. Following the grief of Empire's Edge 2, Zippie went inactive again. He returned briefly to build at [Larry Land 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium#Larry_Land_2). He returned in 2020 and became a member of the [Spawnmasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons), built at [Chunk Haven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chunk_Haven), and helped with the [256K World Download](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/256K_World_Download). At [Sky Masons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sky_Masons), he single-handedly dug the majority of the base to bedrock over the course of several months in 2021 and then aided in the base's expansion in 2022.

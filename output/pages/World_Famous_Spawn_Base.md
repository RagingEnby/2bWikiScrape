The **World Famous Spawn Base**, (also often called **HermeticLock's World Famous Spawn Base**), was a project that was started in February of 2017 by [HermeticLock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HermeticLock). It was started as a social experiment, where HermeticLock would continue to build there no matter how much the location was griefed.
## History
After dying at DonFuer 11 without having a pearl loaded, instead of heading back, HermeticLock started a social experiment where he would build a spawn base, leak coordinates - with the knowledge that many griefers would come to destroy it - and continue to build there. As the history of the majority of bases being leaked on 2b2t resulted in the swift griefing and relocation of its occupants, HermeticLock's experiment would attempt the antithesis of what was normal in the history of a base. After 35 minutes of building on February 6th, 2017, HermeticLock recorded and released [a video](https://youtu.be/NyUhUzYjebk) inviting others to join the base, as well as incessantly posting the coordinates in 2b2t chat on the subreddit.

By February 8th, 2017, the base was slowly growing in size to include small builds by those like [NickHasCancer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NickHasCancer), Dream420, CreativeDetails, and [SalC1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SalC1), including a water slide and a giant windmill; As well as being visited by [Mines](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mines). The group that built the base called themselves the Spawn Builders Guild, which was the foundation of the [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons). By the 9th, the base had been griefed 6 times and by evening/morning of the 10th, [battles at the base had sprung up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP0vs2ffkfY) between the Spawn Builders Guild and roving griefers. Within days, the base was covered in lavacasts; The Spawn Builders Guild reacted by building up into the lavacasts, with their new builds becoming parts of the lavacast.

### Later Restarts of the Base
In July of 2017, HermeticLock attempted a restart of his video series with [AlphaComputer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlphaComputer), [Babbaj](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Babbaj), [NickHasCancer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NickHasCancer) at the location, lasting for at least a few days and not releasing any videos beyond the trailer and a music video. In December of 2017, a gold farm named Project Shiny was added.

On July 27, 2023, HermeticLock created [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiftKJ0WyNY) in which he invited, once again, the entire playerbase to the spawn base; And 4 days later, Herm uploads [a follow-up video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsMVx1IycMI) showcasing some builds made at the base.

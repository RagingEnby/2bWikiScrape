BRABcraft is a [fitfag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Terminology) who joined in 2022. He is most notable for being the leader of [Operation IceRail](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Operation_IceRail).

## Projects
### -Z Nether Ice Highway
Starting in November 19, 2023, BRABcraft began constructing an ice highway in the nether so he could reach his base faster. The highway was located 200 blocks west of the -Z Highway and began directly on the [5K RIng Road](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nether_highways). Soon after the start of the project, BRABcraft reached Z=12,500. Soon, Zombie Pigmen blocking the highway became a major issue, making it almost untravellable. Suggested by [poxab](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/poxab), BRABcraft dug a 1 block gap below the ice, ensuring Zombie Pigmen would pathfind into them and become stuck. After receiving positive support from players travelling the highway, BRABcraft extended the highway by another 12,000 blocks, where he officially stopped the project. The highway has remained active since its inception, helping players without [elytrafly](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Elytra) to travel at high speeds.

### Expanding the +X End Highway
In December 2023, BRABcraft began work on expanding the [+X End Ice Highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/End_highways), with the intention of making it easier for new players to find elytra. At the time, the +X End Ice Highway was the longest highway, reaching X=104,473. He started the highway at X=105,749, around a thousand blocks away from when the original ice highway ended. There, he was planning to create [an incredibly efficient ice highway machine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Hf62xgulzc&t=0s), but he gave up after it repeatedly failed for almost a week. Then, he switched to a [much slower design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSUQYqiu560), which only produced a 1 wide ice path. He used it at the highway level, y=76, for several thousand blocks, where the machine would continuously break. Eventually, he switched to y=200 and 18 blocks left of the axis, where he was able to use the machine stably for around 200,000 blocks, before it broke again. After repairing it, he used the machine until it broke again at x=505,752, where he ended the highway.

### Nether Roof Expansion
On April 15th, 2024, BRABcraft was invited by [Afelot](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Afelot) to join the nether freedom roof expansion project. The idea attracted him because it was very ambitious. He dug out a 1,000x6,000 area in the vertical leg of the +X -Z quadrant. He then began digging the horizontal leg of the +X -Z quadrant, but he got tired of digging and took a break from the project.

### +X Ice Highway
On March 8th, 2024, BRABcraft decided to start an ice highway for the +X axis, as the +X axis received the most traffic according to [FastVincent1's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S6X8jIJ_Cs). He planned to make it out of blue ice, since that would make it the fastest travel method at the time. He moved bases to a location near the +X highway for convenience, then began constructing a trading hall and mob grinder. Because he didn't have priority queue, it took him 3 weeks to complete the base. After finishing it, he used the mob grinder to enchant four shulkers of pickaxes, then began digging the highway. He had planned to dig the highway hundreds of thousands of blocks, but when 2b2t updated to 1.20 and new travel exploits were discovered, he lost motivation and reduced it to 50 thousand blocks. BRABcraft spent the next week digging, gathering, and placing blue ice. At the end, the highway went from 5k to 50k and could be fully travelled in under 15 minutes.

Around late May of 2024, BRABcraft met a player named [Mr.Packco](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mr.Packco), who was helping with repairing the ice highway. Mr.Packco came up with the idea of extending the ice highway to 100,000. BRABcraft dug out the tunnel, and while waiting for Mr.Packco to help, he grew bored and ended up also gathering and placing all the blue ice. The highway extension was completed on June 3rd, 2024.

Later in June 2024, the highway was griefed, possibly by xpandahangoverx, and most of the blue ice from 5,000 to 27,000 was either gone or misplaced. For almost 2 months, the highway remained griefed. After a small break, he came back in August 2024 to repair the highway. BRABcraft also extended the highway closer to spawn, so that it officially started at 2000, -200. BRABcraft then moved bases to a much further location with the help of [oxy2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/oxy2b2t). However, the base was griefed by oxy2b2t shortly after, causing him to lose the majority of his items. Later, from August 25-27, BRABcraft extended the highway to 125,000 nether, or 1 million overworld.

BRABcraft met [GoatOnMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/GoatOnMC) and [Spammer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spammer) on the -Z Ice Highway, and he decided to recruit them to help build the +X Ice Highway. Together with GoatOnMC, BRABcraft started his fourth base, helping him recover from the previous grief. After GoatOnMC left the server after his prio ended, BRABcraft teamed with Whaska to finish the base, which included an iron, wood, sugarcane, gunpowder, slime, string, raid, and skeleton farm, as well as a trading hall. However, the base was found, looted, and griefed a week later by Melon_Awa. BRABcraft and Whaska lost all of their items, including all the blue ice and pickaxes they had collected. So, BRABcraft built his 5th base and regeared with some farms. He then began expanding the +X highway to 250,000.

After over a month of tunneling, digging for blue ice with the help of Whaska, and placing ice, the highway finally was completed to 250k on November 13th, 2024.

### Operation IceRail
Ever since BRABcraft began building the +X Ice Highway, he was thinking about turning it into a group in order to speed up progress. After he finished extending the +X ice highway to 250k, he created a group discord server. He came up with the name, "IceRail", due to a sign he saw on his -Z ice highway calling it a rail. In the discord server, he set 3 goals:

# Build highways for the four cardinals going to at least 375,000 nether (3mil overworld)
# Build highways for the four diagonals going to at least 125,000 nether (1mil overworld)
# Extend the cardinal highways to the overworld world border, starting with the +X

In December, [Matz](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Matz) became the first member of the discord server to apply for a role. He became a publicist, building a public group base and a private farming base with BRABcraft. At the private base, BRABcraft built a staircased mapart of the group's logo. On December 27th, BRABcraft was finally ready to advertise the group. He placed around 20 stacks of maparts around the highways and ring roads of nether spawn and also spammed the chat. Many members of the HWU joined and became tunnel diggers, including [ItsMainLane](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ItsMainLane), [BA4N](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ba4n), and [Musheck](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Musheck). [Jeh Hannqa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jeh_Hannqa) and [Laira](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Laira) joined and became blue ice diggers, and they would get the majority of the blue ice. On December 29th, progress on the 4 cardinal highways began. On January 4th, BA4N finished digging the +X. On January 8th, Musheck finished digging the +Z Highway. On January 11th, Musheck and BA4N would finish the -Z and -X. Then, in hopes of finishing at least one highway before his prio ended, BRABcraft spent over 80 hours in the next week placing guardrails and blue ice. [Orange Dot](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Orange_Dot) coded an addon which allowed blue ice to be placed at eye level instead of at foot level, greatly speeding up BRABcraft's progress. On January 19th, an hour after BRABcraft's prio ended, he completely finished the -X highway. Shortly after, he disconnected for the last time in many months.<gallery>

## History
### Early History
MAC_TONIGHT_ joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) in August 2016 after watching one of [Fit's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) [Rusher Massacre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERu2iVcpiLU) videos. He was usually found playing solo, exploring [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn), or building at his solo base until 2018. This was only interrupted by his brief participation in the [5th Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/5th_Incursion) after duping gear in the [11/11 Dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/11%2F11_Dupe) and being vouched in by [iTavux](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTavux). In 2018, MAC_TONIGHT_ joined [Last Templar](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Last_Templar), where he met [King_Aurelius](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/King_Aurelius), [GenderPretender](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/GenderPretender), [SalC1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SalC1), [DeadlyDarkDragon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DeadlyDarkDragon), and others, while building at [Costco](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Costco). After his participation in the group, he shifted his focus back to stash hunting, ofwhich he had a high success rate. He joined the [Vortex Coalition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vortex_Coalition) with [Dqwnsyndrome](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dqwnsyndrome). Dqwnsyndrome ran a VoCoin shop that MAC_TONIGHT_ would sometimes help with alongside xentedsilver, doing things such as stealing one of [jared2013's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) stashes in order to sell the items from it. With the VoCoin earnings, they both ranked up to [Exalted](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vortex_Coalition#Ranks_and_their_Meanings), the highest achievable rank in [Phase IV](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vortex_Coalition#Phase_IV) of VoCo. The two of them also built a [Skylight update Lag Machine](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Skylight_update_Lag_Machine) capable of crashing 2b2t in under 30 seconds, starting at full TPS. In September 2018, King_Aurelius took a break from 2b2t and gave MAC_TONIGHT_ leadership of Last Templar, which he ran to the end of the year. He presided over a short-lived and un-serious conflict with [Gambino](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Gambino), who was a former Last Templar member, and Gambino's group, [The Crusade](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Crusade), which was a copy of the Last Templar he created after being removed from the group. MAC_TONIGHT_ participated in the [7th Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/7th_Incursion), and then went inactive after its end.

### Emperium and Mongoloid Khanate
MAC_TONIGHT_ returned in mid-2019 when [Etika](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Etika) started streaming on 2b2t. MAC_TONIGHT_ participated in [The Purge](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Purge), and was put in charge of the lag division after ['policemike55'](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/policemike55#Fake%2FNew_Policemike55) saw how powerful the machine was. Following the end of the Purge, MAC_TONIGHT_ became a member of [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium), where he met [TheDark_Emperor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheDark_Emperor), [Jumbo_Warrior](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jumbo_Warrior), [Bajr](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bajr), [ufocrossing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ufocrossing), and others. After [The Vo-Perium Conflict](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Vo-Perium_Conflict) started he sided with Emperium, and leaked several VoCo stashes to Emperium, earning himself the [Delta](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium#Ranks) rank in Emperium. In mid 2019, MAC_TONIGHT_ also rejoined Last Templar, and started the [Mongoloid Khanate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mongoloid_Khanate) with [_pope_urban_ii_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_pope_urban_ii_) as a hangout server for close friends of theirs. MAC_TONIGHT_ learned about a [pig godmode](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Godmode) exploit that allowed him to travel quickly and invisibly, which he used it to follow players down the [Nether highways](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nether_highways), and to basehunt. With that and newly re-enabled elytra, he found a large number of old bases in late 2019. In late 2019, MAC_TONIGHT_ became a guest in the [Spawnmasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons), and later became an initiate, although he went inactive following [Authexploit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Authexploit).

### Rip MAC_TONIGHT_ and the Return
The sudden manner in which MAC_TONIGHT_ exited the community was so abrupt and complete that somewhat serious rumors began to circulate that he had died in real life. Statements of 'Rip Mac' and similar appeared in a variety of locations throughout 2020. He returned in early 2021 and revitalized the Mongoloid Khanate with many new invites, such as [bread_loafs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/bread_loafs), particularly from the [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate) and later [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood). The Khanate built [Mu Megafag base 4](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mongoloid_Khanate#Mu_Megafag_base_4) in April 2021, which was leaked through [The Brownmen's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Brownmen) version of [Nocom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nocom), with which they tracked [Jakethasnake52](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jakethasnake52) to the base.

### Nocom Base Hunting Project
On July 14th, 2021, [Nerds Inc](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc) released their [Nocom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nocom) [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ayxeruAan8), which was soon followed by the Nocom heatmap later that week. On August 7, 2021, MAC_TONIGHT_ started a small group with _pope_urban_ii_, bread_loafs, Jumbo_Warrior, Jakethasnake52, [RainAura](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/RainAura), and [GSlick](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/GSlick) to search the heatmap for the location of bases. The group searched throughout August, before giving the information to SalC1 for a video.

The **BoeMeccan Witch Trials** was an event in June of 2018 which took place on the [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) subreddit and [The Museum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Museum). Following in the wake of [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013)'s [Month of Destruction](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Month_of_Destruction), and the grief of [Block Game Mecca](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Mecca) on the two-year anniversary of [June First](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rusher_Era), suspicions soared as players sought to identify the source of the coordinates to Block Game Mecca and The [Boedecken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Boedecken), another recently griefed base. Members of both The Boedecken and Block Game Mecca, notably [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut), [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids), [_m_o_t_h_r_a_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_m_o_t_h_r_a_), and [YellowstoneJoe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YellowstoneJoe), investigated tirelessly until they found some tangible evidence that tied [Beardler](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Beardler) to both of the griefs.

## History
[The Boedecken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Boedecken) and [Block Game Mecca](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Mecca), two of 2b2t's largest active bases at the time, were griefed within a week of each other. Boedecken was griefed during (but not as a part of) [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013)'s [Month of Destruction](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Month_of_Destruction), whilst Block Game Mecca was griefed a day after his "finale," the destruction of [Equilibrium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Equilibrium). The grief of Boedecken was written-off as accidental, as it was less than 8,000 blocks from an axis. However, when members of Block Game Mecca found damage and stolen items, they completely destroyed the base themselves and began to investigate the source of the leak and grief.

The primary suspect was [Beardler](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Beardler), a new member at Block Game Mecca and the only person in both bases besides [YellowstoneJoe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YellowstoneJoe). He was also the first base member to report the grief in both instances. The players found it suspicious that Beardler also killed his account to [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn) before declaring that the base was griefed, something that he did at both Boedecken and Block Game Mecca. However, all evidence was circumstantial, so nobody could definitively pin it on him.

Although he had recently destroyed a huge amount of major bases, [Jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jared2013) was never seriously suspected - he was too close with many of Block Game Mecca's members. Block Game Mecca member [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) made posts to r/2b2t identifying Beardler and [RyRycat](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/RyRycat) as potential leakers of both bases. Many continued identifying Beardler as a potential leaker, and the evidence continued to mount against him - he took a World Download of Block Game Mecca right before the grief (which didn't include untouched parts of the base), refused to provide chat logs, and had recently kicked all Block Game Mecca members from the [Builder's Guild](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Builder%27s_Guild) for "being griefers". Players [Offtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Offtopia) and [jddinger](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jddinger), however, immediately jumped to Beardler's defense, as he had no history of griefing. The majority of 2b2t's community believed that Beardler was not at fault, as he was an otherwise trustworthy member of [The Museum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Museum) and an active leader of [Builders Haven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Builders_Haven).

[Lifeisgood72](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lifeisgood72) tried to take credit for the Block Game Mecca leak, and a number of individuals did in fact believe him, although it was quickly proved that it could not have been him as he knew no specific details about Block Game Mecca. Beardler still tried to shift the blame on him.

Several days later, Beardler was forced into admitting that he had shared his login across several platforms, and that his account was compromised when he let a friend borrow his account. [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids) posted a public apology on the Reddit, apologising for suspecting Beardler of malicious activity, and declaring that the destruction of Block Game Mecca was an accident. Beardler responded with a promise to be more careful and return stolen items from the museum of BGM.

Roughly a week after the apology, and after the dust of conspiracy had settled, Slappnbadkids and [AlphaComputer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlphaComputer) obtained OP on the 2b2t Museum through experimentation with NBT data on signs. They invited [_m_o_t_h_r_a_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_m_o_t_h_r_a_) as well. Whilst opening chests at Block Game Mecca, _m_o_t_h_r_a_ stumbled upon a book of coordinates created by Beardler, a book that he had brought to BGM when he arrived. The contents of the book were posted on the Reddit, leading to the destruction of several of Beardler's stashes, and [Krobar01](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Krobar01)'s [MOAK](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MOAK). Whilst looking through the other books left behind by Beardler, Slappnbadkids noticed a book entitled, "I'm Gay," written by AlphaComputer. He thought this was amusing and so sent an image to AlphaComputer. Upon informing AlphaComputer that it was found in a chest at BGM, AlphaComputer told Slappnbadkids that the book "I'm Gay" was in fact written and stored at Boedecken. AlphaComputer contacted Boedecken founder and basemate [CainesLaw](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CainesLaw) to ask if he still had the book on 2b2t, and CainesLaw replied that this was not the case. The book had only one copy, but was somehow at both bases.

This realisation would later serve as definitive proof in linking Beardler to both the destruction of Boedecken and Block Game Mecca. Later that evening, Beardler was forced into admitting that he had destroyed Boedecken and Block Game Mecca to acquire their collections of rare items and books, and that he had lied about his innocence.

Slappnbadkids later posted an excerpt from his DM with Beardler, where Beardler gave him jared2013's IP, which he had obtained from the 2b2t Museum staff unprompted. This action solidified the now-unanimous dislike of Beardler, and lead directly to the collapse of the 2b2t Museum. In revenge, The [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate), which had many BGM members in it's leadership, griefed [Purgatory 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Purgatory_2), the second Builders Haven temp base, and Beardler was kicked from Builders Haven. Beardler's reputation was forever ruined, and he soon left 2b2t.

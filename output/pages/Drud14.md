**Drud14** is a celebrated builder that joined in 2016 and participated in several large bases.

## History
### Temple of the Talion
Drud14 joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) in August 2016 after seeing videos by [TheCampingRusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) and [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit). He made a point of not using hacked clients for his first two years on the server. After escaping from [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn), he started his first base 300k out in September 2016. Drud14 named the base 'Temple of the Talion' after a level in [Tomb Raider II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider_II). He built the base entirely freehand and in vanilla without any duped materials. The Temple of the Talion featured a large underground complex with many redstone contraptions and detailed interiors, in addition to a large set of structures surrounding a dome on the surface. He finished building the base in January 2017. Talion was griefed a year later by [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013), [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids), [Tim_Mcnukepants](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tim_Mcnukepants), and [Fake policemike](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/policemike55#Fake%2FNew_Policemike55) as part of the [4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4th_Reich) admidst the [Month of Destruction](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Month_of_Destruction).

### Summermelon

Drud14 left Temple of Talion and turned down an invite to [Boedecken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Boedecken) in March 2017 to accept an offer from [Offtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Offtopia) to join [Summermelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Summermelon), which also was Drud14's first group base. While there, he focused his builds on the floating islands above the base, including his town, airship tower, and observatory. While at Summermelon, Drud14 still refused to use hacks or mods of any sort. After Summermelon's grief by Fit, Drud14 moved to [Numenor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Numenor), although he was only there a short period before its leak as a part of the [BoeMeccan Witch Trials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BoeMeccan_Witch_Trials).

### Mu

Drud14 was invited to Mu early in its lifespan. He finally downloaded a hacked client in order to make the journey out to the base. He played a major role in the planning and preparation of the location with such activities as [TNT bombing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bombers) and terraforming. After the location was ready for building, Drud14 built the entire Northwest quadrant of the base, which the swamp, giant mushroom, giant tree, Greek temple, trireme, and several villages. After spending an extended period building, the base was leaked as a result of the [Authentication exploit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc#Authentication_exploit). After the fall of Mu, Drud14 rejected an invite to [Autumnmelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Autumnmelon) and went inactive except to check on his [Maparts](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mapart).

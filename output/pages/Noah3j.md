**Noah3j** is a builder, known for founding [Avalonia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Avalonia) and [TEA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TEA), and co-founding [Avalysium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Avalysium).

## Early history
Noah3j first joined the server in late October of 2019, at the height of the rivalry between [TeamNoTrees](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TeamNoTrees) and [Team Trees](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Trees). At this time, he befriended [TimeRapier](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TimeRapier) and decided to join Team Trees, rising to the upper ranks of leadership and befriending leader [Rex1258](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rex1258). The three of them set out in December of that year to create [Andromeda](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Andromeda). The base was too close to the highway, and after meeting The [White Lotus Society](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/White_Lotus_Society) and [The Monastery](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Monastery), the three groups would merge to form [Avalonia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Avalonia).

## Avalonia
{{Main|Avalonia}}
After merging into one group, the members of [Avalonia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Avalonia) would found their namesake base 50k blocks away from Andromeda on March 13th, 2020. Having no actual materials to build the base with, Noah3j returned to spawn to perform the [End Portal Duplication Glitch](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Duplication_glitch), having been given knowledge of the dupe by TimeRapier. He befriended [DrBeardStash](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DrBeardStash) at this time, who provided an automated Duplication Glitch after joining the group. Noah continued to build and dupe for Avalonia. He invited most of the people he befriended while duping at spawn to join the base, such as [SpeedDemon0](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpeedDemon0).

While searching for [Map Art](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Map_Art) to add to the base, Noah3j traded map art with [HighAtWork](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HighAtWork). Noah3j then went on to found [TEA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TEA) *(The Escape Artists)* on May 24th, 2020 in order to find and facilitate the spread of map art on 2b2t. Following Map Resets, Noah3j began to make map arts of his own to be distributed at the group's meetings.

Noah3j frequently raided [stashes](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/stash) that he was informed of by [Ionar](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ionar) and DrBeardStash. One such stash that he raided was the [Elysium II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Elysium_II) stash, and he was caught in the act by [Elysium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Elysium)'s leader, [Carlll](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Carlll). In spite of the apprehensive circumstances of their meeting, the two would become friends over their shared interest in building. When both Avalonia and Elysium were griefed, the two decided to merge Avalonia and Elysium into one group: [Avalysium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Avalysium).

## Avalysium
{{Main|Avalysium}}
Noah had a large role in the construction of Avalysium; he was a major contributor to its storage center, nether hub castle, and grand central station. Additionally, he helped [Blocker](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Blocker) sort and manage the duped supplies in the storage center.

Following the grief of Avalysium, due to the resolution of bottled-up drama and many former Avalonia members being removed from the group, Noah3j left the group. He later considered joining back but was stopped due to an ultimatum from [Marcus4761](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Marcus4761). Noah3j runs the re-formed Avalonia group following the split. The two groups are now amicable and talk frequently.

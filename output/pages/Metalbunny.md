# Metalbunny

**Metalbunny** is a multi-group builder, a co-founder of [Kitten Gaming](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kitten_Gaming), and the founder of the now-defunct [Spawn Poets Society](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Poets_Society).

## History
### Early History
Metalbunny joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) for the first time in September 2021 on an alternate account. Metalbunny soon met [AboveAverageCat](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AboveAverageCat), whom together made a base called [Incisor Inc](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Incisor_Inc). Metalbunny returned to 2b2t in the Summer of 2022 as her basemate withdrew from server activities. Metalbunny decided to seek out other players to build with, eventually being recruited to [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) on June 25th, 2022, with her first base with the group being [SpawnFuer 25](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnFuer_25). Metalbunny began constructing trivial bases with DonFuer, and after a few months of dedicated efforts to the group, was invited to build at [DonFuer 25](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_25). During this era of Metalbunny's activity on the server, she started the [Spawn Poets Society](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Poets_Society), a group centered around creative writing, namely poetry. The group was founded on November 1st, 2022.

### Halloween 2022
After the subsequent destruction of two Halloween Event Bases built by varying combinations of [Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperials), DonFuer, [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood), and [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association), Metalbunny and a few other players banded together to build a Halloween base with DonFuer, Imperials, The Collective, and others, under 72 hours before October 30th - the planned event date for most of the other previous bases. Other significant contributors to the base included [HenkieMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HenkieMC), [FreedomHolland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FreedomHolland), [Lukent](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lukent), and [Toska](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Toska). The base lasted to October 30th and a Halloween event was successfully held there.

### Building Style
Metalbunny builds in a primarily fantasy-fueled medieval style but also branches out to other genres such as steampunk, city, and large-scale organic.

#### History
Team Sexy was a small PvP group that was mainly active from late 2018 to mid 2019. The group was often in conflict with [Cydonia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cydonia), [Infrared](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infrared), [Highland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highland), and various other spawn-centered groupss. It would go inactive until the 25th of November, 2019. Later, it would begin to gain recognition server-wide when Mc_Ren used a program to fill in highways during Spring of 2020 and came into conflict with highway repair groups such as [IIS](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IIS). The group would participated in the [Anti-Bedrock Society](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Anti-Bedrock_Society). In the summer of 2021, Mc_Ren quit 2b2t, resulting in the group being disbanded.

}}
The **Vortex Coalition** (usually shortened to **VoCo**) was the longest-running and second-largest faction in 2b2t history from 2015 to 2021. The group claimed to have hundreds of active members, although this figure has been proven to be extremely inflated. The group's activity and presence on 2b2t decreased dramatically in its later years, and by the end of Phase V, the group had virtually no 2b2t activity or presence. It was founded by [Coltsnid](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coltsnid) and [AmericanOreo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AmericanOreo) in May 2015 to "mock" the late [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria) following an incident between the two entities.

VoCo owned one of the most populated 2b2t-related Discord servers, which had over 3,800 members. VoCo had its own economy which was based on its own currency: VoCoin**™**. Players could buy rank-ups, in-game items, or priority queue and paid clients with VoCoin**™**.

## History
### Prologue
Before creating The Vortex Coalition, Coltsnid joined 2b2t on August 17th, 2014. During his first few months, he explored near spawn, walking around until his hunger bar depleted, dying, and exploring more. Colt would sometimes invite friends to play on the server with him.

In December 2014, AmericanOreo, an IRL friend of Coltsnid for 7 years, first joined 2b2t. The two founded a small base 100,000 blocks out from spawn (overworld). This base would later become the Phase I VoCo HQ.

### Phase I
In May 2015, [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86) and the rest of [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria) amassed their members at spawn, marking the [3rd Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/3rd_Incursion) on 2b2t. However, this was largely unknown to Coltsnid and AmericanOreo, who still didn't know what an Incursion was.

Colt and Oreo were on a trip from spawn back to their base, when they encountered a player in the nether named FuzzyFutureFox. At first, the two befriended the player, however, Oreo later killed him for his items.

[FuzzyFutureFox](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FuzzyFutureFox) was a participant in the 3rd Incursion, as Colt and Oreo quickly found out through an angry chat praising [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria) and the Incursion.

Within 15 minutes, [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86), in full god-gear, killed Colt and Oreo quickly.

This chain of events is what inspired Coltsnid to create a group that would mock, meme, and satirize Valkyria, to take revenge against Sato.

The Vortex Coalition was founded by Coltsnid and AmericanOreo in late May 2015. A logo was designed by Colt which resembles the spiral of a vortex. Efforts to harass [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria) began with VoCo's infamous "Did you know?" Spam Bot.

The VoCo Spam Bot, which originally ran on the accounts InvisibleGecko18 and DeadlyMause, would frequently post satirical, over-the-top messages that were designed to annoy Sato and other members of [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria).

The bot would post messages such as ">Did you know? The Vortex Coalition is currently occupying and renovating Spawn." and ">Did you know? The Vortex Coalition single-handedly carved out all of the Nether highways." These messages are the source of all 2b2t "Did you know?" memes.

The VoCo/[Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86) rivalry was one of the oldest on the server and was often memed. The nickname "VoCo" came to exist through constant arguments in the [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) chat about the group, with the term being coined by someone as saying very negative things.

Over the next couple of months, VoCo rose in membership, peaking around 25 members. [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) only had an average of about 40 active players around this time in 2015. As such, VoCo still represented a relatively large percentage of the 2b2t player base, thanks to the ease of joining and the lenient nature during the later half of 2015.

### Phase II
The Vortex Coalition was not as active during the first half of 2016, and consequently suffered a loss of members and relevance. However, they began to increase in activity just before [TheCampingRusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) joined the server, who subsequently brought hundreds of players onto 2b2t. With the influx of new players ready to make their mark on 2b2t, and the group's policy of accepting anyone regardless of being a newfag/oldfag, The Vortex Coalition was able to recruit far more members than they ever had before.

The Vortex Coalition worked to expand its reach by advertising through memes on /r/2b2t as well as /r/TheVortexCoalition. They also began actively uploading videos to their YouTube channel. This allowed the VoCo community to expand very rapidly. The Vortex Coalition was so prevalent at the height of its popularity that the 2b2t subreddit implemented a new rule forbidding low-quality posts due to VoCo memes that completely covered the subreddit's front page for 4 days.

Roles in The Vortex Coalition had remained relatively static up until mid-2016. After the large increase of activity, The Vortex Coalition was able to obtain many members, which required a shift in roles to distinguish trustworthy members and new members. In mid-August, the Vortex Coalition added its first new Executive member since Cyan; Ovnel (now known as Joe as of 2017).

#### Demeanor
]]The Vortex Coalition remained relatively peaceful during this time, not antagonizing other groups, and declaring themselves a noncombatant third party in the [Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Rusher_War). They were neutral with many groups and allied with many others over the years. They viewed PVP as "pointless" and the vast majority of their members did not partake in PVP at spawn.

#### Phase II Lag Machine
In September 2016, Sengorn_Leopard built one of the server's largest lag machines (pictured below). He was later granted an Executive role in VoCo as a reward his efforts, as well as to solidify the group's control over the lag machine. The coordinates of this lag machine were later leaked by Coltsnid in retaliation of Sengorn_Leopard betraying the Coalition during the disciple/religion meme.

#### The Wrath of VoCo
During 2016, The Vortex Coalition created their own take on the [Wrath Outpost](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Wrath_Outpost) at X: 420 Z: 911 (pictured right), which they built overnight. It was unfortunately destroyed within days of its creation during the 5th Incursion. This was the first consecutive summer that The Vortex Coalition had renovated its spawn base. They have continued this trend into 2017 with another renovation at 420/911 (which has already been destroyed). Structures built near spawn are not expected to last long, and VoCo knows this.

#### End of Phase II
Coltsnid began to call himself a god, and VoCo members that accepted him as their Lord and savior were accepted into his group of disciples. While many thought this was funny, some were not happy with this change of pace, and this caused controversy within the group. Some members who outright denounced Coltsnid were banned.

Around this time, one of the group's executives, HermeticLock, who was responsible for running the website, decided to change the home page to a meme displaying the [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) logo, which further escalated the tensions within the group. On January 13th, 2017, this controversy caused executive member Sengorn_Leopard to ban all users from the Discord. When Coltsnid became aware of this, he deleted the Discord server and posted [an "official" disbandment](https://redd.it/5nz8za) on /r/2b2t. This post gained a lot of attention and once again the focus of /r/2b2t was The Vortex Coalition.

Before going inactive for the next several months, Coltsnid had a few more memes up his sleeve, such as "VoCo II" and "selling" the server to "RockyEric" and HermeticLock.

### Phase III
On June 2, 2017, The Vortex Coalition ended its second Off-Season and began recruiting new members. With 2b2t falling into decline, it was thought that activities in The Vortex Coalition would likely never reach the levels it had during the Rusher Era (however, the group itself had since grown past the size it was during the Rusher War). Despite the decline in 2b2t popularity, their Discord server was one of the most populated 2b2t related servers with over 330 members (Phase III numbers, purged of inactive members regularly).

Salamander, Joe (ovnel), [Cyan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cyan), and [househousehouse1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/househousehouse1) remained as the executive members.

During Phase III, The Vortex Coalition built 11 separate group bases, two of which are major bases sprawling across thousands of blocks. One being a large above-ground city, another being a large underground cave housing a dwarven fortress. They also renovated their 420/911 spawn base for 2017, although it was griefed heavily soon after (pictured right).

The Vortex Coalition had over [110 active members](https://imgur.com/MYCfoRu) as of January 21st, 2018. Around the same time, VoCo been heavily investing in spawn operations, such as public infrastructure, spawn bases for new players, and public builds. They were also actively working on a streamlined currency system for VoCo members called VoCoin™.

In mid-December, reports began to circulate that members of The Vortex Coalition had been griefing public infrastructure, such as the [Southern Canal](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Southern_Canal). To push back against this destructive behavior within the group, [Coltsnid](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coltsnid) refined the VoCo [Terms & Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20201205075148/https://www.thevortexcoalition.com/terms) to prohibit public builds being targeted by group members.

On December 28, 2017, The Vortex Coalition announced that it would be taking over executive operations of the [Spawn Infrastructure Group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Infrastructure_Group) (SIG), and provide VoCo with resources to further mobilize spawn efforts and to efficiently produce reliable roads, bridges, and outposts for all spawn travelers.

#### End of Phase III
On January 30, 2018, Coltsnid announced that Phase III of VoCo was coming to a close. In this statement, it was also announced that all VoCo staff members, including Executives and Trinity members, would be fired, and new staffs would be chosen during the Off-Season and at the beginning of Phase IV. The position of Discord Moderator was the only staff position, which anyone could apply for.

<blockquote>"This was the most streamlined phase VoCo has ever had, and it yielded great success, not only for our Coalition but for 2b2t as a whole.</blockquote>

<blockquote>...It has been an honor working with you all throughout the past 7 months to take The Vortex Coalition to new heights, never seen before by any 2b2t group. Our reach is nearly endless when we work together. Our dominance on 2b2t is so unbreakable even I couldn't truly end VoCo, and that means something.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I will see you all in Phase IV!"</blockquote>

-Coltsnid, Phase III closure announcement.
#### Phase III Off-season
The Phase III's Off-Season went on record as The Vortex Coalition's most active Off-Season up to that point. While overall activity within the group decreased as expected, a handful of members and staff remained dedicated to ensuring activity never came to a standstill.

During the 2018 Off-Season, VoCo was a major participant in the 6th Incursion, continued further development of VoCoin™, and kept up consistent recruitment levels. In many ways, the 2018 Off-Season is foundational preparation for the beginning of Phase IV, which was expected to begin in May or June.

On April 12, 2018, Coltsnid announced the first Executive members since all staff members were fired at the end of Phase III:

joe/ovnel – Executive

[HermeticLock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HermeticLock) – Executive

[househousehouse1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/househousehouse1) – Executive

[iZac](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iZac) – Executive

Starting in Phase IV, all staff ranks in VoCo were required to be maintained with activity.

### Phase IV
On June 15, 2018, on the three-year anniversary of VoCo, Coltsnid announced that The Vortex Coalition Phase IV was starting.

After a purge, the group was sitting at just over [150 active members](https://imgur.com/ckPDbQV). The last time VoCo had this many members was during the height of the Rusher War.

#### Prime Minister Elections
On Tuesday, June 19, The Vortex Coalition held the first Prime Minister election of Phase IV, with 8 candidates running.

HouseCasterly won the popular vote, with 44 members choosing him to become the first PM of Phase IV. He went up for re-election after his 2-week term concluded. He chose not to run for re-election.

Casterly had overseen a large-scale VoCo event on 2b2t with several dozen members in attendance. This event, while successful, was the only event that happened during Casterly's term.

On Tuesday, July 3, VoCo held the second PM election of Phase IV, with 6 candidates running.

Ross won the popular vote with 38 votes, with Zoe coming in closely behind at 33.

On Tuesday, July 17, VoCo held the third PM election of Phase IV, with 3 candidates running.

Ross won the popular vote once again having 33 votes. Zoe came in second again with 20 votes. This election was surrounded by drama and led to fighting between members, though this was later resolved.

#### Notable Events
*In June 2018, VoCo acquired the domain [joinvo.co](https://joinvo.co/), which redirected to the Apply page on their website. According to statistics released by Coltsnid, this dramatically increased the rate of new users joining the group.
* On July 1, 2018, The Vortex Coalition Discord server reached 600 members for the first time.
* On July 3, 2018, The Vortex Coalition had 219 registered members, the former record number for any centralized group in 2b2t history.
*As of July 17, 2018, The Vortex Coalition had 242 registered members. This completely smashed its own record of 219 members – previously the largest number for any centralized group in 2b2t history.

### Phase V
On June 15th of 2019, the fifth phase of the Vortex Coalition commenced. An event took place on the same day to celebrate, in which over 100 VoCo symbols were built and up to 30 members were in a voice chat at one time. Many new benefits to VoCo members were introduced in a short period of time.

Shortly after, the Vortex Coalition Server Network launched, at the IP hub.joinvo.co. It contained PVP, survival, creative, and more. At the launch event, there were 21 players online at one time. The start of Phase V was deemed successful.

Not long after the start of the server, the alliance with Emperium that lasted over a year abruptly ended, due to "immature members' lack of respect and failure to uphold the alliance". The ties were quickly cut. Emperium members also killed and/or provoked VoCo members, thus intensifying a rivalry.

Aggression towards Emperium escalated quickly, as VoCo started taking down multiple Emperium stashes and bases while exposing their perceived wrongdoings. Emperium also increased hostilities towards VoCo, destroying a few bases and attempting to turn VoCo members against the group.

It would be reasonable to say that Phase V was the beginning of the end for VoCo. Although some notable achievements were done during this phase, including the return of VoCo Server Network, the construction of the Wrath of VoCo II, the construction of the largest ever vortex, and the expansion of the VoCoin**™** economy, the group began to decline in membership and by the end of Phase V, it had virtually no presence or activity on 2b2t and instead only played on clones. The member count was also highly inflated and although the group claimed to have over 200 members, only ~20 or so were actually active in the Discord, and even less could be seen on anarchy servers. The group continued to censor its members more and restrict them during this time. For example, members were not allowed to speak about or type other group names, such as "emp", without a bot deleting the message and warning the user.

Phase V ended on February 28, 2020.

### Phase VI
VoCo Phase VI began on June 15th, 2020, 5 years after VoCo was initially founded in 2015. It should be noted much of this phase took place on their Discord server and little to nothing took place publicly on 2b2t, and thus cannot be truly verified until documented or shown.

Phase VI launched with many updates to VoCo, including an overhaul of the group's basing system and media branch, as well as implementing the VoCo Credence System for additional security measures at bases and events.

In September 2020, The Vortex Coalition surpassed 7500 applications since 2015, which was an average of ~4 applications per day (at the time).

On November 15th, 2020, The Vortex Coalition released its VoCoin**™** 2.0 update, which completely overhauled its currency system. This update included the addition of VoCo XP, a new rank (Ascendant), transactions logging, and an experimental VoCoin**™** API for use with developers.

As VoCo grew larger over the years, the group expanded onto other anarchy servers alongside 2b2t, such as Constantiam and 9b9t. VoCo had subgroups of members who play on different servers. VoCo was still active on 2b2t, and considered it their primary server, but most official business and activity was now done in private on 2b, out of the public eye.

This phase would also go down as the most rule-heavy and restricted phase of VoCo. Coltsnid had been growing paranoid ever since the beginning of the VoPerium conflict in Summer 2019, and his paranoia reached new peaks during this time. He forbid VoCo members from talking to anyone who had left the group, and banned every past member of VoCo. According to VoCo rules, these previous members were now considered "EoVs" (Enemies of VoCo). This meant that VoCo members would have to block them and cease communications with them, which angered many members, including leadership such as iZac. VoCo staff had also had its members screenshare their DMs to them to prove they were not insiders, and this practice was used much more during this phase. These new restrictions and invasions of privacy would eventually lead to almost every VoCo member and staff member leaving the group, which would result in the disbandment of the Vortex Coalition for good.

### Disbandment
On March 10, 2021, Coltsnid posted a statement on the VoCo subreddit announcing that the group was being disbanded. In his statement, [Coltsnid](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coltsnid) accused "an obsessed group of anarchy players" of stalking, harassing and working against him for years, and stated that he was shutting down VoCo as a "last resort". In the weeks leading up to this statement, many high-ranking members of the group had either left or been kicked out. Shortly after this statement was released, the Vortex Coalition Discord server and [SIG](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Infrastructure_Group) Discord server were either deleted or made private. The VoCo website and YouTube channel were also deleted, and the Vortex Coalition subreddit was set to private.

## Bases
The Vortex Coalition claimed to maintain around 365 bases (although the logistics of this number are up for debate; [Coltsnid](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coltsnid) claimed that this was an estimate, while most others saw it as a meme), which are spread throughout the 2b2t map in all quadrants. As the years passed, and VoCo presence and documentation decreased, it is safe to assume this number also decreased, although an exact approximation cannot be given due to many being private bases and the nature of 2b2t.

VoCo defined a base as "a relatively safe and controlled area outfitted with amenities including beds, ender chests, defensible fortifications, and renewable food sources." Many of these bases were small outposts that serve as "checkpoints" for members to set their bed and possibly farm/autofish. Some, on the other hand, were large, active bases that could have up to 15 members. It should be noted a base did not have to have active resident members to be considered a base, possibly inflating numbers.

## Relations
The Vortex Coalition was one of the largest centralized 2b2t group ever assembled. However, despite this, they rarely allied or fought with other 2b2t groups or factions. VoCo was generally neutral towards most groups unless antagonized. Initially, VoCo allowed members from other friendly 2b2t groups to participate in their ranks without issue. However, due to paranoia in the group's leadership, VoCo members were essentially prohibited from participating in 2b2t groups and activities outside VoCo towards the end of the group's life.

VoCo has had two conflicts with [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium) over the years, due to VoCo claiming that [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium) was too toxic and immature. The two groups allied after their first conflict ended, but this alliance eventually fell through.

### Controversies
As the longest-running group in 2b2t history, VoCo became a somewhat controversial group on 2b2t. Much of this is due to the many VoCo claims that could not be backed up, especially its activity. Once a large and public group, it had since declined to a smaller, more private group on 2b. This was pointed out due to a lack of any pvp presence it once had, lack of public player interactions, lack of public events/builds, and lack of updating its information to reflect its quiet and slow move to other anarchy servers (mainly [Constantiam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Constantiam)). Because of this, VoCo largely became a meme to other groups, known for being "alive" when in reality being a "dead" group as far as the public was concerned.

### Security Practices, Restrictions, and Censorship
The Vortex Coalition was widely known for its invasive and ineffective practices when it came to the group's security. After the VoPerium conflict, the group isolated its members in a bubble and stopped their members from talking to the greater community, claiming that everyone was out to get VoCo and that other groups were jealous and obsessed with VoCo and its success. The group also had bots & staff alt accounts in 2b2t-related Discords which sat and monitored the Discords. These bots and alts would receive notifications when VoCo was talked about, and they also were in there to make sure that no VoCo members were stepping out of line. Vortex Coalition staff also barred VoCo members from talking to former VoCo members, members of "EoV groups" (Enemy of Voco), anyone who disliked VoCo, and former insiders. Any criticisms in the group were quickly dashed and criticizing VoCo or its practices would result in mutes or other punishments, with the reason being "[FUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty,_and_doubt)". Vortex Coalition staff was also planning on having its members switch from Impact and Future to Wurst because they believed, without any evidence, that the developers of these clients would use their clients to attack VoCo. This is a good indicator of the paranoia of the management in the group's final days. They also frequently screenshared their members' Discord DMs, an ineffective practice that didn't prevent insiding and instead just angered the members who had their privacy violated. These invasive and restrictive policies would lead to the death of the group.

## Ranks and their Meanings
IMPORTANT NOTE: Ranks were **not necessarily examples of active players.** Some players in the past worked their way up to VIP or Elite, only to withdraw in activity from the group or 2b2t as a whole. As with the ranking of players, they were mostly *suggestions* of how players fit into the hierarchy of the group. Many ranks were completely useless and purely cosmetic since you could buy your way through the rank system. A shadow rank system similar to China's social credit system was instead implemented, which was the credence system.

Supreme Leader: [Coltsnid](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coltsnid) – The owner and operator of The Vortex Coalition and its affiliated projects.

Co-Founder: [AmericanOreo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AmericanOreo) – Involved in the foundation of VoCo.

Senior Executive: Coltsnid's right-hand men, helping guide VoCo.

Executive: A rank given to members that are trusted with Discord power and secrets of The Vortex Coalition.

First Class™: This rank was for those that have shown immense leadership capabilities within the group, and was a precursor to the Executive rank.

Moderator: A rank chosen by the executive team to keep the Discord civil.

Prime Minister: An elected official from the lower-ranked members of the group. **(No longer in use as of Phase V)**

Ascendant: The most reputable non-staff rank in VoCo. Ascendants were granted extra permissions in the Discord and were usually involved in most if not all VoCo activities.

Eternal: A highly reputable player who had demonstrated exceptional dedication and loyalty to VoCo.

Exalted: An extremely well-respected rank in VoCo.

Elite: A prestigious rank for those that were fully trusted within VoCo.

Eminent: A respected player with significant sway within the group.

VIP: A trusted player with more privileges in the group. These players typically spent time working on bases with the group and growing the empire as large as it could possibly be.

Member+: A player who earned the trust of the general population is granted this rank as a testament to that trust. These players were typically well settled into the group and had begun to take part in activities with other players and bases.

Member: The basic confirmed rank. You had been admitted to The Vortex Coalition if you bore this rank.

Initiate: A two-month trial role given to fresh recruits. Extremely similar to member trust-wise, however, not officially a member of The Coalition.

## Trivia
*The Vortex Coalition was the first group on 2b2t to pioneer its own functional group currency on Discord.
* The Vortex Coalition was responsible for the "Did You Know?" meme due to the group's bot. There are over 150 original VoCoBot DYK messages.
*The Vortex Coalition had its own queue skipping system, known as VoQueue.
* The Vortex Coalition spawn base was at x420 y69 z911, and features the ruins of an obsidian megastructure built there, known as "The Wrath of VoCo."
* The Vortex Coalition official motto was: "The Vortex Coalition is an elite group of players dedicated to making 2b2t a better place". However, this is a meme and was specifically designed to trigger those who are not fond of VoCo.
*Each VoCo base was named with a corresponding number since the first VoCo base. For example, VoCo base 297 (AKA Gamma Base) is the 297th base built by VoCo. Other examples include VoCo base 276 (base raided by Tumorous) and VoCo base 329 (AKA Delta Base).
*The Vortex Coalition had a Christmas Album, which it expanded every holiday season with song parodies.
*On January 17th, 2021, The Vortex Coalition acquired the Discord.gg/2b2t vanity URL. This URL was active until March 7, 2021, when another group claimed it.

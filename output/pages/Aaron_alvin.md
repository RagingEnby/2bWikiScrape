# aaron_alvin

**aaron_alvin** was a member of the [Cult of the Melon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cult_of_the_Melon), a group that built at a variety of large bases, such as [Summermelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Summermelon) and [Mu](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mu).
## History
Aaron_alvin joined 2b2t in Fall of 2016 as a result of [TheCampingRusher's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) video. He met [Toshie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Toshie) and [Vaxent](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vaxent) while traveling the [Nether highways](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nether_highways), and with them and several others, built at [Wintermelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Wintermelon). While there, aaron_alvin built his great hall and a castle. After its grief by the [4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4th_Reich), aaron_alvin moved to the short-lived memebase [Springmelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Springmelon), before building a considerable amount at [Summermelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Summermelon), contributing the docks and Melon Manor. Following its grief by [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) and several others, aaron_alvin moved to [Mu](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mu) with most of the rest of the group. While there, he built the Cathedral of the Melon Goddess, one of the largest builds at the base besides the central basin itself. Through building at Mu, he was also invited to the Spawnmasons, where he was a guest for an extended period. After spending years at Mu, it was eventually made public as a result of the [Authentication exploit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc#Authentication_exploit). After the grief of Mu, aaron_alvin moved to [Autumnmelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Autumnmelon), but it was griefed before he could finish designing a large build for the base. He has been inactive since its grief in 2020.

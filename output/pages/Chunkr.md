## History
Chunkr joined 2b2t in late 2015 after reading the [Vice article](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xywekq/the-worst-place-in-minecraft) on the server. He befriended [C4RTM4N](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/C4RTM4N), and played the server regularly until the [Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rusher_War). Chunkr joined the [4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4th_Reich) when it was created and participated in a variety of griefs with them, including [Point Nemo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Point_Nemo) and [Helios](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Helios). While in the 4th Reich, Chunkr was introduced to [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids), who brought him to [Block Game Mecca](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Mecca) upon its foundation in January 2017. Chunkr was also invited to the [Spawnmasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons) upon their foundation.
Chunkr discovered the [Crafting Dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Duplication_Glitches#Crafting_Dupe) (often called the 'Chunkrdupe') in late July 2017, and subsequently released it to the public. Following the grief of Block Game Mecca, Chunkr moved to [Block Game Jerusalem](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Jerusalem). Amidst rising queue times, Chunkr stopped playing in late 2018 along with most of the rest of the [Block Gamers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Gamers) at the time. He returned to 2b2t in January 2022.

## History
### Foundation
After the fall of [Block Game Mecca](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Mecca), the [Block Gamers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Gamers), led by [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids), moved to a new location, which they decided to call ‘Block Game Jerusalem’. Included in the group were Slappnbadkids, [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut), [Juicybear](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Juicybear), [fr1kin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fr1kin), [_m_o_t_h_r_a_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_m_o_t_h_r_a_), [Chunkr](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chunkr), [Drathader](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Drathader), [Vertrix](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vertrix), [TheColdOneJC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheColdOneJC), [macca_2508](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/macca_2508), [GVNewman](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/GVNewman), [Beezlesnort](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Beezlesnort), [Tanaxis](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tanaxis), [Todarac](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Todarac), [Krobar01](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Krobar01), and [ufocrossing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ufocrossing).
After moving all of the group’s materials to the new location, The [BoeMeccan Witch Trials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BoeMeccan_Witch_Trials) were concluded, and the Block Gamers griefed [Purgatory II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Purgatory_II) with several others under the banner of the [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate).

### Initial construction and inactivity
After the dust had settled, [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids) quit the server and the new BGJ group went inactive by the end of Summer 2018. A few large projects had been started or finished, including Krobar01’s skull and obsidian temple, macca_2508’s bowl, the Temple, the storage hall, Beezlesnort and ufocrossing printed several voxels: the Ark of the Covenant, an alien, and the Eiffel tower. In addition to one other small structure, these are the only transplanted builds at the base. Todarac also built his embassy in [Turrim](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Turrim).
Activity continued at a slow pace. [The Block Gamers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Block_Gamers) planned to wait for 1.13 and avoid loading too much of the surrounding area until that happened, and many of the base members stopped playing the server regularly. Krobar01 came in the Summer of 2018 and built his ‘Hovel’ and Eye.
Many visitors arrived throughout this timespan including [0x22](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0x22), [Babbaj](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Babbaj), [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan), and [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa). The account [JewishBanker](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Babbaj) was often afk at BJG through this period as part of the [Nocom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nocom) exploit. The base nonetheless stayed inactive for most of 2019 and 2020.

### Revival
This all changed when [Hopen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hopen) was griefed on August 7, 2020. The Block Gamers decided to bring many of the residents of Hopen to BGJ, and [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) assumed leadership of the base. Joey_Coconut also brought the main builders from [Fort Aqua](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fort_Aqua) in the same wave. That equated to [LordGalvatronMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/LordGalvatronMC), [Crawket](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crawket), [DarkXL6](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DarkXL6), [FamilyPumpkin6](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FamilyPumpkin6), [Zaanga](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Zaanga), [mattvtd](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/mattvtd), and [DJDJ_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DJDJ_) being added to the group. Activity at the base exploded, although mostly from the old members.
Shitpost builds were cleaned up, and many more, higher quality shitpost builds took their places.

### Jared's visit
Trouble abounded quickly, however, with [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) leaking the coordinates, and making threats to blow up the base in early September. A pretty big fuss came about, and many people became aware of the base's existence. After Jared got to BGJ and got a tour, he never returned to the location.

### Explosion in base size
Many large structures were created in late 2020, most notably including TCOJC's section of the base, the majority of which was built in this period. Also built were Crawket's cyber palace, Galvatron's section of the base, and [DarkXL6](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DarkXL6)'s 'New Jerusalem'. Macca continued with his bowl.
Vertrix and Joey_Coconut continued with a wide variety of smaller builds in their respective areas. [IronException](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IronException) and [Rathause](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rathause) were added to the base group in this period. [_m_o_t_h_r_a_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_m_o_t_h_r_a_) rejoined the base in October and built his mushroom.

### Continued leaks
In December of 2020, jared leaked the coordinates through [orsond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/orsond) to many people, who also all happened to be friends of the base members, such as [PepsiLord420](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/PepsiLord420) (leader of [PVG](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/PVG)), [Sakuya](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sakuya), [0x22](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0x22), [HermeticLock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HermeticLock), and others. These individuals prevented griefs repeatedly behind the scenes, oftentimes without Joey or the Block Gamers even knowing at the respective times. Coordinates were also leaked to [D_loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_loaded), and by extension, several other [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) members. They remained completely respectful, not touching the base, or poaching the materials. Around April Fool's day, an account by the name of xX_Mr_Rogers_Xx flew to BGJ. After a tense couple of hours, he started helping build the temple and then vanished the next week. It was long-assumed that xX_Mr_Rogers_Xx was an elaborate prank on the part of one of the base members. Upon the grief of the base, it was revealed to be [iAmZeiss](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iAmZeiss), sent by D_loaded to check the base out. Zeiss was added as a full member of the base on the morning of the grief.

### Continued construction
Construction continued, with Galvatron putting sizable time into his region of the base and Joey completing his second Brick Biome.

Construction on the temple itself started after almost 3 years in design limbo. It was not finished by the end of the base. [leijurv](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/leijurv) was added to the group about this time. [FamilyPumpkin6](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FamilyPumpkin6) and [DJDJ_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DJDJ_) both quit for unrelated reasons.

Joey_Coconut finished his desert village over the spring, and [marcus4761](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/marcus4761) was added to the base following the grief of [Avalysium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Avalysium). Galvatron continued with his area, Crawket with his, and Joey_Coconut and IronException with the temple. Rathause also constructed his village at this time. Mattvtd began building his town, and DarkXL6 constructed his build entitled 'New Jerusalem'.

Regular activity slowed down until it was only Joey_Coconut, Galvatron, _m_o_t_h_r_a_, and Rathause.

### Final days
Following sizeable drama between jared2013 and Joey_Coconut, and the grief of [Imperator's Base 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperator%27s_Base_2), jared left the BGJ discord for what the members claim was the 6th or 7th time. Thinking the base's lifespan was limited, all the group’s materials were preemptively moved away.
Galvatron, Iron, and Rathause built clear to the end of the base. Zaanga started to build near the end, and [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids) returned physically to the base after almost 3 years away.

## Grief
On June 16th, jared2013 leaked BGJ and [Whitehaven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Whitehaven), and had sent people to grief both bases. Discussion of a self grief was held at BGJ, but ultimately the base members decided against it. Instead, several [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons) were invited to BGJ to help grief, and the coordinates were leaked in global chat and many discord servers.

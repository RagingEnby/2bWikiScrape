}}**Asgard II** was a base built by the remnants of [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria), the [Legion of Shenandoah](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Legion_of_Shenandoah), and others in 2015. It was their next project after [Fenrir](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fenrir), and would later grow to house a population of 30 players.

## History
Asgard II was founded after [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob) found the coordinates of [Asgard I](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Asgard_I). It was built in a savanna biome, just like Asgard I. The base began on March 14th when Sato86 uploaded an imgur album of the eventual grounds for the base, showing key aspects of it that had great potential for an interesting base.

## Griefing
{{Quote|There has never, ever, been closure on what happened at Asgard II.|Fit, July 25th, 2016}}

The leak of Asgard II's coords has been a convoluted and debated story. Many stories have been made speculating the destruction of Asgard II. Some people claim that [OreMonger](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/OreMonger) was responsible for the leaking due to an anonymous person with an alternate account handing him the the coords, who was suspected to be a spy at the base, while others believe that it was leaked by [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86) due to internal struggles between [James_Rustles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/James_Rustles), [xarviar](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xarviar), and many others at Asgard II. Some believe there was an exploit used to find it, and many other stories of the like have been told. Regardless, the news of the public leak caused the residents to panic, with some fleeing and others blowing up parts of the base so that no one else could claim to have destroyed the base.

In a video published on August 24, 2019, Fit claimed that the base coords were accidentally leaked by [Pyrobyte](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pyrobyte) (one of the builders), and that he hid it so well that almost no one found out.

The members were angered after the destruction of the base and initiated the [Third Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Third_Incursion), which began on April 29, 2015. This was two years after the founding of Valkyria, and it lasted through the whole month of May, in revenge for the destroyed base. After the Incursion, Valkyria began to dissolve and eventually disbanded. Some members of Asgard II went on to found other bases, the most notable of which being [Aureus City](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Aureus_City).

## Trivia
*There was a armor stand with a [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa) [player head](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Player_Heads) in the square, which was reverted to an Alex head during a visit to the base by [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster).
*Players have continued the tradition of pre-destruction of bases after the fall of Asgard II in order to prevent claims of destruction.

**0Channy** is a Vietnamese YouTuber. He usually makes videos about 2b2t survival and 2b2t history. He is widely known for co-founding [The Autumn Drain](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Autumn_Drain).
## History
Channy joined 2b2t in August 2020, making his [first episode](https://youtu.be/ZYbEji3VHDs) of his "2b2t survival" series on August 26.

His videos mostly talked about his journey on the -X highways until the end at X: -2,000,000. Then, he came back to the [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn). After a long traveling on +X highways, he met some other travelers, including Nathan823 and ThatAlecs. He began constructing their [first base](https://youtu.be/5l3RgHwhmSw) at X: 250291 Z: 1355. A day later, a player named Aurylite found their base due to a terrain exploit. They soon became friends and went millions of blocks out to build [a new base](https://youtu.be/LRfAwXi6hVI).

Nathan823 and ThatAlecs went inactive after 2 weeks at the new base, leaving Aury and Channy as the remaining members. Channy, making the decision to move on, killed himself and came back to Spawn, and then started walking on the [Southern Canal](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Southern_Canal).

On the journey, he made a video touring [The Drain](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Drain), and right after the video he began a rebuild project of the ruins of [The Drain](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Drain). This project resulted in the creation of the Autumn Drain, the largest reconstruction project in the server's history up to that point, with many groups participating.

After the destruction of the Autumn Drain, he arrived at the Shortbus base (Calculator II) but got killed by [Armorsmith](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith) not long after ([video](https://youtu.be/vktuu5YSJWo)).

In December 2020, [Orsond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Orsond) and [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut)  invited him to a new spawnbase by the [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate) and [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen) called [Adamantium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Adamantium), where he built a giant turtle and also made a [video](https://youtu.be/ZgdRuEVj42k) on the base. He participated intermittently in both the Guardsmen and Shortbus Caliphate throughout 2021, ending up at [Rat House](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rat_House) near the end of 2021. He also joined the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) and built at [Nautilus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nautilus).

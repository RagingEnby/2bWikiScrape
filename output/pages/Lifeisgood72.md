**Lifeisgood72** was a player that joined in March 2016 as a result of the Vice article. It all started when he was viewing /r/minecraft. He found a post that linked to the Vice article about [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t). After the rusher invasion, he rediscovered the server, however was unable to play due to the queue.
## History
Lifeisgood72's first action on the server was heading to the [Valley of Wheat](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valley_of_Wheat). He mined a few bushels of wheat without replanting, then headed away from the axis for [Overworld](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Overworld) travel. He decided to travel across the diagonals and head to 100k,100k. Along the way, he found [Beefytown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Beefytown), griefed it, and then continued on. When he headed to 100k,100k, he made a World Trade Center recreation which he posted about on the 2b subreddit. Then he griefed a bunch of other, smaller places, like [Fitlantis](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fitlantis).

In November 2016, he founded [Pacific Heights](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pacific_Heights), a modern/futuristic city-style base whose 5 members were friends of Lifeisgood72. [Donster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donster), after being invited to the base, leaked the coordinates to  [0xymoron](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0xymoron) and [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids), who griefed it on livestream in January 2017. Lifeisgood72 then went on to start a solo base in June 2017 named [Ocala](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ocala), an opulent 19th century European style city, which would be his base for 3 years before being found and leaked in February 2020. He built at [Avalysium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Avalysium) in 2021, being invited shortly before its grief.

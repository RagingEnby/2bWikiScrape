**The Blind Eye Clan**, originally known as Ragnarok, was a group of players who were dedicated to blowing up spawn during 2016, however, they were unsuccessful.

## History
The first member of the group was Flip35, who had planned to blow up spawn with TNT bombers since he first joined 2b2t. He did not have enough resources or assistance for the bombers, so he individually invited other players to join the cause under the name Ragnarok. He would eventually change the name to the Blind Eye Clan. The group attempted to make alliances with [Team Aurora](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Aurora) and the [Peacekeepers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Peacekeepers) for their first attempt at bombing spawn which was scheduled for October 22nd, 2016. However, the alliances were never made due to the coordinates being leaked to the meetup base between the groups and [The 4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_4th_Reich) destroying the base. This event would cancel the bombing. The Blind Eye Clan did not pursue further attempts at alliances due to not wanting to limit its members.

After the 11/11 dupe, the Clan had enough resources for the whole bombing of spawn. The Clan scheduled to once again attempt to bomb spawn during the 5th Incursion as [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) called for the leveling of spawn. However, this never happened as the 5th Incursion began to decline. As the 5th Incursion began to die, it brought the clan down with it and the group eventually disbanded.

#### Relations
The Blind Eye Clan had attempted to form alliances with [Team Aurora](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Aurora) and the [Peacekeepers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Peacekeepers). The Blind Eye Clan had also become a division of the 5th Incursion. They held disdain for [The 4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_4th_Reich).

Most of the former members merged with [VoCo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/VoCo) (i.e., [househousehouse1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/househousehouse1), [Sheer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sheer), and [Flip35](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Flip35)).

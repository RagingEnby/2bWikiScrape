}}**Facepunch Republic**, also known as **Peoples' Republic of Facepunch**, or simply **Facepunch** or **the Republic**, was a large group on 2b2t players who joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) from the now-defunct forum facepunch.com beginning on April 27, 2011. These Facepunchers came to 2b2t to play and create bases where their forum members could build and bring order amongst the server's anarchy, and at their height, they contained members in the hundreds. The group went to war against the pre-existing [4channer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4channer) population just one day after their formation. [chezhead](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/chezhead), who created the famous forum thread, led the group for several months until [Phagocytic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Phagocytic) assumed power into 2012, before what was left of the group collapsed in June that year.

Following the fall of the Republic, many Facepunchers went on to have prominent roles in the following years, most notably the Facepunch base [Hitlerwood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hitlerwood), which merged with the [Black Flag Group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Black_Flag_Group) to create [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria) in 2013. In November 2019, chezhead, the original founder of the Facepunch Republic, returned to create the [New Facepunch Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/New_Facepunch_Republic_(2019)) – a revival faction committed to secrecy, nonviolence, and good vibes.

## History
### Founding
The future founder of the Facepunch Republic, chezhead, joined 2b2t on April 26, 2011. He found a large griefed castle near Spawn with extensive mines below it, which he explored. He was joined by his friends Mattyyy, a Facepuncher, and Coolity, who he made a base with there in the mines. On April 27, 2011, at 4:57 PM UTC, chezhead created his now-famous thread on the Facepunch forums, titled "Upon the Shoulders of Giants: An Adventure in 2b2t", officially beginning the Facepunch Republic. Over the next several days, over 100 players would apply for membership. The original base transformed into a "bustling stairwell" with many rooms and mines.

Later on April 27, the Facepunchers decided to move out from their base, due to lack of space and proximity from Spawn, and traveled in search of a new base. They found a ruined castle, which they repaired and inhabited to become their second base. A rules and jobs system was created with farmers, resource collectors, and defenders, and the base included a treasure hall, meeting hall, tower, and guard post. These events marked the first known group bases on 2b2t. The ability to form a society was cited as a result of the culture and closeness of the Facepunchers, unlike what much of the original 2b2t population, mostly [4channers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4channers), was used to.

{{Quote|Rules: 1. No killing or hurting other Facepunchers. 2. No destroying bases or the property without permission or renovation purposes. 3. No standing in front of the meeting room without the current speaker's permission. 4. Do not take anything in the treasury if not needed at the moment. 5. Never create diamond tools other than swords, unless given permission by Chezhead.|chezhead}}

Later on April 27, after amassing around 20 members, 4channer [luke2thebun](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/luke2thebun), using his "mweorz" alt account, arrived at Camp Facepunch with fly hacks, blowing up the base with TNT. The members scattered, most of them killed, including chezhead, who died in an ensuing fire. The attack, known as Greyskull's Stand, marked the beginning of the Facepunch War. chezhead and much of the Republic's morale were reduced after the event, as they found it unfair to be going against hackers. mweorz camped at the base, killing any arriving Facepunchers.

Their initiative to bring order failed badly as their actions were seen as an insult to the whole server, beginning a hunt for Facepunchers on the server. This led to a server-wide conflict known as the [Facepunch War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Facepunch_War), which led to the group's inevitable demise. After chezhead left 2b2t and gave up hope, the remaining Facepunchers failed to keep the group together and eventually disbanded in February of 2012. Their forum was still essential to 2b2t as a media and a sort of memory book of the server.

One of Facepunch's main and most notable spawn bases was [2k2k](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2k2k), located at approximately {{Coords|-2000|-2000}}. Built by Facepunchers and led by [Phagocytic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Phagocytic), who took control after chezhead's departure and initial disband of the Republic, this was their last-ditch effort to fend off against the attacking [4channers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4channers). Since their base was close to spawn, it was griefed multiple times, although this didn't stop the Facepunchers from repairing it for over a month. Eventually, the group began to decline once again as more and more Facepunchers gave up on repairing 2k2k. They either went to live somewhere else or left the server. The Facepunch Republic collapsed in June of 2012. 2k2k was covered in a giant [lavacast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/lavacast) before being griefed down to bedrock. The last Facepunch thread was closed on June 7, 2015.

Despite the Republic being disbanded and several Facepunchers leaving after 2k2k, there were still some who remained. These Facepunchers either fused into new groups, went solo, or never advertised their Facepunch origin and secretly made new bases. The most notable group of Facepunchers still remaining after the Republic's fall was the group started by [Coldwave](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coldwave), in which he hoped to create a new republic. He founded [Hitlerwood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hitlerwood) which later fused with [Anatolia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Anatolia) (aka the Black Flag Group) to create [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria). Valkyria could be considered the Facepunch Republic 2.0 due to their Facepunch ancestry.

It occurred during 2011-2012. It started when [chezhead](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/chezhead) rallied everyone on the Facepunch forum to join 2b2t and form a peaceful anarchy in the server. The 4channers disagreed with this and attempted to take down the Facepunch Republic.

#### Summary
Following an influx of players coming from the Facepunch forums in April 2011, [luke2thebun](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/luke2thebun) griefed [Camp Facepunch](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Camp_Facepunch), retroactively named Greyskull's last stand, on April 28th, 2011, effectively beginning the loose ties between the groups. Chezhead later declares war after denial, mainly due to his advisors suggesting it. Many 4channers and individuals begin to attack Facepunch Bases. Spies in the forums, along with a majority of 4channer's using [Cheat Clients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cheat_Clients), led the Facepunchers into a decay as many of their bases were raided and griefed, since most were very close to spawn.

#### Major events
Some of these do not have exact dates, as they have been lost over the years.

*April 27, 2011 — Chezhead posts the first 2b2t-related thread on the now-non-existent Facepunch forum (facepunch.com) and declares the founding of the Facepunch Republic to bring a peaceful anarchy. 4channers assemble to combat this. A kill-on-sight list is assembled by Chezhead.
*April 28, 2011 — Greyskull's Stand marks the first battle of the impending war. Camp Facepunch is destroyed by Luke2thebun. Chezhead denies war.
*April 2011 – July 2011 — Peak of war and Republic power. Several bases are made and destroyed by raiders and [4channers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4channers).
*July 2011 – October 2011 — the idea of the Republic begins to wane and decline. The last thread of the Republic on facepunch.com is posted on July 7, 2011, titled "2b2t V2: there is no FP republic". Facepunchers begin to give up and quit the server. Chezhead gives up on the Republic in October.
*October 2011 – February 2012 — Players continue to try to keep the Republic together after the departure of Chezhead as leader. This fails and the Republic collapses in February.
*June 2012 — the last band of Facepunchers dedicated to the Republic, led by Phagocytic, try to create a spawn base known as [2k2k](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2k2k), with the hopes of constantly rebuilding it to make griefers give up. This fails, as the Facepunchers themselves got tired of constantly rebuilding it, and began to lose hope. The group slowly gave up and disbanded causing the end of the old Republic.

#### Trivia
*The war in itself is almost similar to [The Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Rusher_War) four years later: a group of new players trying to make a change in 2b2t, with old players trying to take them down. Major differences include the fact that the amount of facepunchers joining the server was less, not more than the number of people who already played, and the fact that the Facepunch community was much less centralized around a specific leader, and (somewhat) more mature than the [TCR](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) community.
*Despite the war having much fewer casualties than the Rusher War, four years later, the war saw more armed combatants die than in the Rusher War due to the fact that the war was during the Beta stages of Minecraft, meaning enchantments, crystals, totems, withers, etc. were non-existent back then, making killing much easier than it is today. The only reason the Rusher War outweighs in the casualties department is because of the mass slaughter of the gearless newfags at spawn.

#### Major Groups Involved
*Facepunch Republic
*4channers

#### Minor Groups Involved
*[Judge's group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Judge%27s_group) - recruited from both sides
*[Brotherhood of Diamonds](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Diamonds) - gave diamonds to anyone
*Various raider groups and independents

### New Facepunch Republic
:*Main article: [New Facepunch Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Facepunch_Federation)*

Despite a failure to achieve peace and stability in 2012 and the Facepunch forums shutting down, in November 2019, chezhead returned to the server to revive the group and establish some outposts, starting the [New Facepunch Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/New_Facepunch_Republic). In the beginning, the group was controlled by 0Neb, who was [Armorsmith](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith)'s advisor at the time. They both intended to use chezhead for their manipulative plan to "take over" other factions. This resulted in [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86)'s involvement, who managed to get chezhead to take back the Discord server and get rid of both Armorsmith and 0Neb.

## Trivia
*Facepunchers (not counting New Facepunchers) still roam the server today such as [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob), [lemler33](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/lemler33), [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2), and a few others.
*The term Facepuncher is similar to Rusher as it is used in the exact same way. It was used to generalize a group of players and not necessarily mean they were part of the Republic (while most were), but just to refer to them that they came from [Facepunch](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Facepunch)
* The Republic named their bases federation shelters, outposts, camps, forts, and towns.
*The group had a system of social classes, which included (but not limited to) the president, advisors, mayors, and citizens. [chezhead](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/chezhead) was the president of the Republic, which essentially meant he was the leader and had full power over it. He made the ultimate decisions. Advisors were put in place to keep bases in check and were required to arrange meetings with all advisors online in order to agree with large decisions, with chezhead having the final say. Mayors ran towns and shelters and kept the citizens of the town in line. The citizens were basic builders and common players.
*The group undoubtedly left a legacy that is still seen today. Their failed attempts to create a sort of peace and order in anarchy changed the way players played 2b2t for years to come through creating base groups and just groups in general, seeking a system and a sort of order, good or bad, despite the ruthlessness and lawlessness of anarchy.
*The original Facepunchers were the first noted group to have access to the [piston duplication glitch](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Duplication_Glitches), which was the first-ever noted duplication glitch in server history.

# AnimeTiddie (An1metiddie)

**AnimeTiddie** is a builder and notable player on 2b2t, known for founding the group Obscension and leading the [Pitfight](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pitfight) events.

## History
AnimeTiddie became interested in [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) after coming across [fastvincent1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fastvincent1) on YouTube and watching his videos on the server. When he first joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t), he was playing the Java Edition for the first time after moving from console, so he had some difficulty adjusting to the new version while also adjusting to anarchy in general. He used [Impact](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cheat_Clients) as his only hacked client and barely knew anything about it. After dying many times, he eventually escaped spawn through the -- Nether Highway. Here, he mainly built solo and learned about [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t)/Java for almost a year playing with a "singleplayer with chat" attitude that many other notable builders had carried in the past. He built an obsidian tower using buckets of lava from the nether and water streams. The first friend he ever made on [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) was a player named [FreeLees](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FreeLees), who told him he needed to name his tower and start his own group. AnimeTiddie heeded his advice and established a group called "Obsidian Ascension", later renamed to Obscension. Some other early members of the group included Svenn_Svenn and Slythens. AnimeTiddie came up with a way to build pearl stasis chambers out of water streams and he used those to move their first stash to the group base 3 million blocks out. Afterwards, he built an entire pearl complex at the base where up to 8 people could set pearls and be brought back individually. The group base was eventually griefed by [Dectonic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dectonic) in retaliation, after FreeLees helped grief [Chunk Haven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chunk_Haven). This event led to Obscension becoming an event focused group, leading to the creation of [Pitfight](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pitfight).

## Pitfight and other Projects
AnimeTiddie is most widely known for founding and running [Pitfight](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pitfight), an End Crystal PvP tournament. The event ran monthly on the server, for a year, from 2021-2022. It was, at the time, the largest spawn event, regularly drawing crowds of up to 60-70 players at a time and bringing Priority Queue on the days it is held to above 100, a rare feat during school months. AnimeTiddie also worked on group bases intermittently between different Pitfights. Some other projects he has done include: Spawn Archer, [SpergClub](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpergClub), HermeticLock SMP, Spawnfuer/Webzone, Boletus, Sora Blue, Heimsland

## Name Change
At the end of 2022, Animetiddie changed their account names to Anime2b2t and 2b2tComunnity. Their YouTube and Discord names were also changed to just "Anime".

## Anime and the Astral Brotherhood
In 2022, Anime also applied and was accepted into the Astral Brotherhood, where has built several bases with his many friends in the group including: [Solaris](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Solaris), Polaris, Taiyo, [Stellaris](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Stellaris), and [Dubrovnik](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dubrovnik).

## Retirement
Anime announced his retirement from 2b2t on July 31st, 2024, due to the server no longer being a viable environment to host PvP competitions, due to the strict anti-cheat.

}}**Fate** was a building group founded by [iAmZeiss](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iAmZeiss) in late 2020 after the disbandment of [Crimson Star](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crimson_Star), from which many of its original members came from.

## History
Fate was a building group founded by [iAmZeiss](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iAmZeiss) following the end of Crimson Star. The first base, Acropolis, had originally been a Crimson base that Fate (composed of largely the same members) continued the construction of. Most of the base was built by Zeiss and [I_tri](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/I_tri).

After many of the members did not want to make the trip out to Acropolis, Lateott was founded as a spawnbase for new members, and it drew many to the location in its short lifespan. The coordinates were leaked shortly thereafter when [iiGryxz](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iiGryxz) was tokenlogged by a client called 'etikahack'. The group subsequently self-griefed the base.

The third base of the group, Hyperfate, was also originally a Crimson base, which was founded by Zeiss in September. It had largely been neglected by the group because it was deemed too far from spawn to be easily accessible, but too close to achieve the security of a millionbase. The group moved there after the grief of Lateott, and remained there until it was griefed by [Team Catgirl](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Catgirl) on 7 December, 2020. Following the grief of Hyperfate, the group largely went inactive, with the members migrating to other groups, such as [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) and [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate).

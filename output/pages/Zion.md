**Zion** was the longest-lasting base created by the [Facepunch Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Facepunch_Republic) during the height of their activity in July 2011. It was griefed in April 2012.

## History
Zion was founded during the height of Facepunch-driven activity on 2b2t. According to [Phagocytic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Phagocytic), it was griefed at one point, but the server had a rollback a few days later and the base was restored.

### Description
The entire base was located in a large underground stone dome, which was filled with grass, trees, clouds made of snow, and wooden buildings. The dome was lined with torches, and jack-o’-lanterns were placed around the base for extra lighting. Other hallways and rooms branched off from the main dome, containing storage rooms and the members’ beds.

### Leak and grief
In April 2012, Phagocytic gave the coordinates of the base to [xarviar](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xarviar), who was initially friendly towards him. However, when xarviar learned that Phagocytic was the new leader of the Facepunch Republic and was promoting the server on Facepunch, he leaked the coordinates, and Zion was abandoned and later griefed by [Kaameron](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kaameron). The members of this base, as well as most of the remaining Facepunchers on the server, regrouped at [2k2k](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2k2k). They decided to rename 2k2k to Zion in order to honor the legacy of the original base, though many still referred to it as 2k2k.

## History
He joined in September 2016 from [Rusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher)'s videos. He joined Team Veteran for a time and eventually left, regretting having joined the group.In January 2017, he joined the [Holy League](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Holy_League) and based at Constantinople until its destruction in March 2017. After [the first donkey dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Duplication_Glitches), he started heading to the world border in April 2017. He arrived 1 month after the diggers and worked on "Austwitz", a base on the world border about 500 blocks from [Point Nemo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Point_Nemo). After about 2 weeks, everything in the vicinity of Point Nemo was lavacasted by [Babbaj](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Babbaj). After an Elytra stunt fail in the world border nether hub, he died and was sent to spawn due to a bed breakage and stopped playing out of rage.

In July 2019 he came back and joined [Elysium I](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Elysium). After building there for a while, he was given the bible crash exploit from [Carl](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Carlll_) and proceeded to crash the server multiple times before it was patched. After [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) reenabled [bookbanning](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/bookbanning) as a side effect of fixing the lag, he joined the [Book Club](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Book_Club) on October 29th and helped engineer some of their lag machines. Using his 300k stash, Book Club members constructed "[househousehouse1â„¢](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Househousehouse1) server rapers".After the spit-up of the Book Club when dq6 sold out to Hause, Redstoner helped with chunk banning operations around spawn and ended up banning 0,0 nether with [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013).

In April 2020, he started [The Bakery](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Bakery). The joke came from when he was talking to steve3 and discussed reviving the Book Club as a new, even better meme. The Bakery 'baked' newfags with furnace chunkbans around the [bedrock comet](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ZiggyBase#Bedrock_Comet) and 0 0 overworld. He led the efforts for 2 weeks straight managing to organize dozens of players to build bans every 12 hours around the clock. He managed the supply chain as well, with up to 2 dubs a day of furnaces needing to be flown in. He managed to ban 56 players personally and the bakery as a whole banned 326, plus an estimated 200 more from closing 0,0 overworld for 4 days. slightly beating their previous score of 400 *as* The Book ClubDuring the Bakery, he allied with the [Infinity Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinity_Incursion), eventually joining them. He participated in Operation Black Sky and The Lava Curtain projects, providing footage of the former to Fit and [making a video on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gBq-EIHqJI). He also led the Water Cube Project alongside [BachiBachBach](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BachiBachBach) for a month and a half finishing the 250 million water source block project.During June of 2020, Redstoner was messing around with lag machines and found a [reliable priority ban method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke2XP1zOsC0) called Skylight lagging. He used this to priority ban multiple people [including streamer Jakethasnake52.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQNx7lmDTG0) The chaos this caused forced Hause to reset most priority bans, including Redstoner's main account.

## History
### SmackAttack86
Smackattack86 joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) in 2014 after reading about the server in a Minecraft-oriented magazine. He kept to himself until mid-2017, when he became a member of [Peacekeepers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Peacekeepers) and [Highland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highland). He re-founded [The Guild](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Guild) after [HermeticLock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HermeticLock) disbanded the original group that he was in. He operated a 2b2t News YouTube channel from 2017-2018. SmackAttack86 indefinitely left the server in 2018, removing most 2b2t-related media of him in the process.

SmackAttack86 rejoined 2b2t around late 2020 under the alias 'TheDem1urge', although he was relatively open about being SmackAttack86, despite some attempts at keeping that private. He built with [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate), [Crimson Star](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crimson_Star), [Fate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fate), [Teslic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Teslic), [Guardians of Andromeda](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardians_of_Andromeda), and [Donfuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer) throughout that time. He also participated in the [Tenth Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tenth_Incursion), and built at [Cum Zone II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cum_Zone_II) and [DonFuer 20](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_20). He later on quit the server again for another couple years. However, after changing his name back to TheDukeOf2b2t which was his name in 2015, he rejoined the server again in early to mid 2023, remaining fairly inactive but working on multiple projects with different groups such as [Millennium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Millennium) and [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association).

As of the end of 2024, SmackAttack86 spends most of his time hanging out at smaller bases with close friends.

**CurtPvP**, or **Curtis**, is a small YouTuber who was friends with [TheCampingRusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher). He used to own Rusher's factions server, The Archon, and was one of his comrades during [the Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/the_Rusher_War). He was also known to be one of the players responsible to 2b2t's [queue](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/queue).
## History
Curt is close friends with TheCampingRusher. Due to this, he was a part of [Team Rusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Rusher) during [the Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/the_Rusher_War). However, Rusher gave him a special role during the war to essentially be a sort of ambassador to [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster). During the war, Rusher suggested to Hausemaster a much better queue system than the much earlier one implemented early June, 2016. Curt was given the responsibility by Rusher to be in charge of 2b's [queue](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/queue) system when Hause gave permission to Rusher to implement it. The queue server was a seperate server at the time, so Hausemaster was more lenient with its trust.

Curt is no longer in charge of the queue system, as The Archon was sold off to a new owner and that Hause has retaken responsibility after the Veteran Queue was removed, in which Curtis told Fit was "100% Hause's idea".

Curtis and his powers over the server have been criticized by much of 2b2t's community at the time. Many people believed that Curtis was abusing his status, with many having screenshots of conversations (twitter, most often) of him threatening to ban or kick them. Curtis was also semi-responsible for [#FreeToro](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Torogadude).

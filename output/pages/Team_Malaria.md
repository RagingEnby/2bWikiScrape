**Team Malaria** was a group whose goal was to be feared at spawn. The group split from [Team Imperia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Imperia) in late 2016.

## History
Team Malaria started when members of Team Imperia, [Flyinqq](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Flyinqq), [Sextinq](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sextinq), and [Crystalinqq](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crystalinqq), split off due to arguments with Imperia hierarchy some time in December 2016. The group moved on to attack anyone at spawn. The group decided to attack [VoCo's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/VoCo) [Gamma Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Gamma_Base) when they managed to inside the base thanks to the help of [CokeQueen360](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CokeQueen360). Luckily, all valuables were retrieved before the grief. In retaliation, VoCo sent one of their members, [Salamander](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Salamander) , to pose as an insider and give coordinates to CokeQueen's dupe stash to members of Malaria. Salamander posed the coordinates as actual VoCo bases and so Team Malaria ended up griefing their own team member's base.

Eventually, stability in the group did not last long as Flyinqq and Crystalinqq had an argument with Sextinq and split off to create [Team Coca Cola](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Coca_Cola) . Sextinq continued to lead the group until they were insided by [RusherIsAutistic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/RusherIsAutistic) and lost a lot of their items. The group eventually withered away as former members got bored, lost hope, and/or joined other teams. They eventually disbanded sometime in February 2017.

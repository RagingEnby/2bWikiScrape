# policemike55

**policemike55** is a player that joined in early 2011 and later sold his account. The player that pretended to be him did so for several years and later became active in the [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium) and several [Incursions](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Incursion).
## History
policemike55 joined 2b2t in 2011, joining as part of the [Facepunch Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Facepunch_Republic), and based with players such as [passie05](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/passie05), [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2), [CreamOFTheSlop](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CreamOfTheSlop), and [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob). He based at [Squid Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Squidbase), [Ziggy Town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ziggy_Town) and [Plugin Town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Plugin_Town). He is also one of few players who had access to popbob's 2012 Backdoor.

Policemike quit in 2015 and sold his account to a newer [midfag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/midfag). This other player is referred to as "Fake Mike" or simply policemike55.

## Fake/New Policemike55
The new policemike55 was an active general and participant in the controversial [Seventh Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Seventh_Incursion) and would also later go on to join [the Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/the_Emperium).

Though some players were suspicious, Fake Mike was generally accepted to be the original policemike. The truth about his new identity came out after [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan) contacted the original Mike and posted screenshots of their conversation in a now-deleted post on the 2b2t subreddit. Afterwards, Fake Mike left the server and changed the account name.

The original "Fake Mike" changed the username of his account circa 2020, which led to multiple new Fake Mike's coming into existance due to the sniping of the username. It is unknown who owns the account today, but it is assumed that it has passed a few hands since [the Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/the_Emperium)'s "Fake Mike" had changed the username.

## Trivia
* The original Mike has a completely blank [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/PoliceMike55) he used to comment on various old 2b2t videos.

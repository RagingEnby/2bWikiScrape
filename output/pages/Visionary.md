}}**Visionary**, also known as the **Visionary Organization**, was a group founded in 2017 by [Sinatra](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sinatra). The goal of the group was "to create a community who strive to better the community and not create toxic waste that the server already is. Striving for a better relation between players in the community to create good communication again."

In 2021, the group leader Sinatra tried to revive the once dead group. They set up a Discord and got some old members of the team to rejoin. The group ended up dying once again due to a lack of management.

#### History
The group was known to have directly opposed the [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium), and was wiped out as a result, with its base destroyed and its Discord deleted.

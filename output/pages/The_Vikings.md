}}**The Vikings**, also known as **The Dutch**, were a raiding group in 2011. The group is known from an encounter including [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2), [x0XP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/x0XP), and the [Brotherhood of Diamonds](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Diamonds).

## History
Almost nothing is known about the group outside of their confrontation with [x0XP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/x0XP) and [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2) at [NFE](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NFE). They were called into the raid by their allies, [The Pyylaandia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Pyylaandia). While initially being driven back and killed by the defenders of NFE, they later griefed the base along with The Pyylaandia.

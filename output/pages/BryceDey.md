# BryceDey

**BryceDey** is a builder and community member of 2b2t, known most for being the founder of the [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association), an overseer in [The Highway Workers Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Workers_Union), and is also known for participating in many community projects.

## History
BryceDey joined 2b2t on November 9th, 2019, after the [WWE Donkey Dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Duplication_glitch) was leaked to the public. Using this dupe, he got himself settled and began his first base, Vesuvius. He then took a break from the server, before returning in 2020, becoming far more active than he had before. In late 2020, he met members of the [Highway Workers Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Workers_Union), joining the group in doing so. Later on, he met [DanDucky](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DanDucky), [Kingsxtt](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kingsxtt), [Paulsteve007](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Paulsteve007) and [XGamer_BePlayinX](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/XGamer_BePlayinX) at spawn. This resulted in them forming a small group, which eventually lead to the founding and expansion of the [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association). Furthermore, this led BryceDey to his invitation of his first group base outside of SBA called the 69 Clubhouse started by the TSA, where he met other friends that would join SBA in the future, such as Baconator, YFUA, and many others.

## Groups and Projects
In 2020, BryceDey joined the [Highway Workers Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Workers_Union) after meeting [Tullybob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tullybob) and [Dom1405](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dom1405), who inspired him to become a highway worker. Ever since, he has been heavily involved in infrastructure and [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn) Projects. These projects include the [Eclipse](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Eclipse), a Nether Spawn project lead by [Oofplux](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Oofplux) with the task of preventing new players from escaping spawn by exploiting nether portals, and Bepitone, a Spawn Project spearheaded by the Spawn Builders Association of carving a giant sign 'BEP' into the [Obsidian roof](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Obsidian_roof) with Baritone. These projects, as well as his near-daily cleaning of Nether Spawn, lead to BryceDey's account having mined over 1 million obsidian, and further spread his influence.

BryceDey created the 5x3 gap in the obsidian 2k spawn wall, with help from his friend Dekto. Prior to the 1.19 update, players would struggle to find holes in the ceiling to fly out of. Bryce decided to change that problem in 2022 and made a hole for any spawn dweller to escape/fly out of. The project took 2 weeks and over 400,000 obsidian mined.

BryceDey was also vastly known for the creation of the "Bep" chat spam, and the following Bep spawn ceiling excavation project done by SBA which involved over 10 million obsidian mined to create the servers first inverse spawn logo.

## Spawn Builders Association
In April 2021, BryceDey, along with the other members of the spawn party, founded the [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association). Originally founded to organize the cleaning of spawn, the group expanded into a community of players who maintain Spawnbases. The group's Central Double helix, a staple at every one of the over 70 spawnbases made, was originally inspired by one of BryceDey's solo bases. For the first 50 bases, the SBA almost exclusively built under 10,000 blocks away from spawn, and still often do. Hosting events and bases so close to spawn is dangerous, but they also believed the accessibility of the base was more important because they were always recruiting new members.

## Events
BryceDey has participated in many events during their history on the server, such as Pit Fight, Squid Games, Sumo, but every once in a while he builds one himself to host for his group SBA. In June of 2024 Bryce and his good friend Yamez built a recreation of the Call of Duty Map; Nuketown, and hosted a hide and seek event for SBA and the VEA.

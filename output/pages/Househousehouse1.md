**househousehouse1** (also known as **househouse1**, **house1**, or **hhh1**) was a notable [newfag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/newfag) throughout his time on 2b2t. He joined in June of 2016, and has since left [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) for good in April of 2020.

## History
House joined 2b2t in June 2016 and quickly rose through the ranks in the [Vortex Coalition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vortex_Coalition).

House would become a leader in the Vortex Coalition throughout Phase II and III, and was known for creating large lag machines that took the server TPS down by over 10. He continued this after his shift to being more active in [Armorsmith's Followers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith%27s_Followers). House made himself a reputation as a shitposter as he posted many highly upvoted memes on the 2b2t [subreddit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/subreddit) when it was a smaller sub, about 1,000 to 10,000 members. Additionally, House built an extremely high-quality dirt hut near spawn which was toured by [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) on March 31, 2017. Fit's video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Un52mPJPTf0).

Using the AAC BoatFly exploit, house was the first player to travel to the -+ (Southwest) quadrant world corner. He temporarily quit the server due to arguments in July 2018 and logged out at the world corner, but returned in 2019. He was involved in both [Armorsmithâ€™s Followers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith%E2%80%99s_Followers) and the [Vortex Coalition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vortex_Coalition) upon his return.

House is also known for the creation of the 400, 400 nether bedrock hole, as well as larger holes at [DonFuer 10](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_10) and the [World Famous Spawn Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/World_Famous_Spawn_Base). He also founded [The Brownmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Brownmen) in November 2019.

In April 2020 he decided to quit 2b2t for good, and hasn't come back since.

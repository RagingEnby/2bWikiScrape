The **Gape Group** was a group that saw its first roots in February 2014, when [Victor96](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Victor96) and [_Aaron_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_Aaron_) made a giant hole near 1k -1k (Cyto's Gape). This was because of drama between Aaron and [CytotoxicTcell](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CytotoxicTcell), where the hole was supposed to resemble her gaping ass. The goal was to create a massive hole down to bedrock. Some people came to the area to build a few castles and fortresses, but nothing much came of it. It was later griefed on September 13, 2014, with [lavacast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/lavacast)s filling in the hole. Eventually, 9 players would revisit the area after the disbandment of [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria), but it was griefed once again even harder.

A few members of Gape 1.0 then decided to go out farther from spawn to start the new Gape, **Gape 2.0**, also called [Caleesii](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Caleesii)'s Gape (As she was one of the builders). The members of the base were [coconut4](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/coconut4), [Caleesii](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Caleesii), [James_Rustles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/James_Rustles), [lil_chuckster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/lil_chuckster) and [Victor96](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Victor96). But there were a few people who visited the area. This gape was also planned to be 128 x 128 blocks wide, but would later be extended to 254 by 254 blocks. It was estimated that group would have to mine over 1 million blocks and would take members around 3-5 weeks in total to complete.

Some members of this group, including Victor96 and Caleesii, later based at [The Monastery](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Monastery) and renamed it "Gape Haven" sometime around mid-2016.<gallery caption="">

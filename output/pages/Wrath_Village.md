**Wrath Village** was created on August 29th of 2019 when [Nambrose](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nambrose) and [Jakeolover](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jakeolover) were bored at spawn after [Cloud Club](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cloud_Club), which Nambrose missed due to being on a cruise. [Vexxer232](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vexxer232), [DudeTrash](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DudeTrash), [CB_Gator](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CB_Gator), and [CactusDuper](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CactusDuper) were also invited to help build a replica of [Wrath Outpost](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Wrath_Outpost). The six players were able to complete the build in nine hours using nine shulkers of ender chests. After the main structure was completed, other players were invited to hang around and build things. Most players were invited but a few players, such as [Jadestrouble](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jadestrouble) and [OverFloyd](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/OverFloyd), found the base randomly. On September 3rd, three days after the base's completion, it was leaked to [EnderPearl](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/EnderPearl) who arrived at the base on stream, unknowingly compromising its coordinates. [BarrenDome](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BarrenDome) also visited the base.
## Leak
After the coordinates were leaked, players began spamming them in chat. Members of Wrath Village were able to delay potential griefers by sending fake coords in chat to throw people off, but eventually Nambrose decided to blow up all the builds he made and other members followed suit. The base, being made mostly out of obsidian, is still recognizable.

## Other Builds
Wrath Village had many builds besides the Wrath itself. To the east of Wrath, there was a replica of a pyramid from [The Valley of Wheat](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Valley_of_Wheat). (???) built a giant dinosaur skull from obsidian, and (???) brought an unbreakable end crystal to be put at the top of wrath, making it unmovable.

**SoiledCold** is a player who founded the [Democratic Group Alliance](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Democratic_Group_Alliance) and started [TeamNoTrees](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TeamNoTrees).

## History
SoiledCold joined in September 2016, after seeing a video by Poke. During 2017, SoiledCold would just build farms at spawn and helping other new players, even creating a group, the Red Cross. Due to the low queue in 2018 SoiledCold was able to play more on the server with friends and eventually joined [VoCo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/VoCo). SoiledCold used VoCoins to purchase items and would sell some items for a short amount of time.

During 2019 SoiledCold became anti-newfag after the long queue made it harder for him to join the server and after a player he helped insided him. SoiledCold started numerous projects to combat newer players, but needed more players for his projects to work, so he created the [DGA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Democratic_Group_Alliance). With the DGA he was able to build more bases and do more projects at spawn. One of SoiledCold's and DGA's biggest project was [TeamNoTrees](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TeamNoTrees) after SoiledCold saw a new player at spawn able to get tools and armor after walking only a few hundred blocks out. SoiledCold later got mentioned by FitMC and БУЛДЖАТь, both videos together got 4.65 million views.

At the beginning of 2021 SoiledCold started work on a 2b2t shop after watching a documentary about the defunct online black market [Silk Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(marketplace)). At the beginning, development was slow, with a developer is known as Nyaa~ deciding to help with the project. After months and months, very little work was done, the old dev was kicked off of the project. After this, they picked a new developer. Development of the shop went fast, with it being mostly done in a few months. On May 1st, 2021 FitMC made a video about the shop and its automated delivery bots, bringing the shop alot of traffic and bring over 1200 registered users in the week after Fit's video. He is no longer involved with the site.

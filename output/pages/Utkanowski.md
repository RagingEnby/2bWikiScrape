## History
### Early History
In 2020, influenced by kingoros's 2b2t videos, he started playing on anarchy servers and logged into 2b2t for the first time in 2021. He didn't have a permanent name at the time, so he has multiple unregistered transferred/closed accounts. In 2022, influenced by [GlowskiBroski](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/GlowskiBroski), he added “owski” to the end of his name. He met [vHakan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/vHakan) in late 2023 and was invited to [The Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium).

### Jellyfish Space Station I
In 2022, he met [Poyraz_Kaptan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Poyraz_Kaptan) and they decided to form [Cool Dudes](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cool_Dudes). In 2020, while discussing Space Valkyria 3, which [Poyraz_Kaptan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Poyraz_Kaptan) had found, they decided to build an end base themselves and started designing it. The base was finished in Creative mode in August 2023, and they named it Jellyfish Space Station because of its jellyfish-like appearance. Since the base was very big and would take a long time to build, they started looking for players to help them. They met [Grim3169](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Grim3169) and someone anonymous, and started the construction of Jellyfish Space Station in October 2023, finishing in January 2024. Towards the end of January, the base was griefed, and [Poyraz_Kaptan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Poyraz_Kaptan) kicked [Grim3169](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Grim3169) out of the group, believing that [Grim3169](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Grim3169) was responsible. Utkanowski didn’t believe [Grim3169](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Grim3169) did it, got into a fight with [Poyraz_Kaptan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Poyraz_Kaptan), and left the group. Two months after leaving the group, he did more research and found out that an anonymous person had leaked the account information to an untrusted foreign player, which is why the coordinates were exposed. He sent proof of this to [Poyraz_Kaptan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Poyraz_Kaptan), and they started talking about it again. Once things were cleared up, he made peace with [Poyraz_Kaptan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Poyraz_Kaptan). The anonymous person was expelled from the group and [Grim3169](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Grim3169) rejoined.

### Jellyfish Space Station II
He went to the coordinates where they planned to build the second base using Trident flight exploit. He started the construction of the second base, met new players, and invited them to join. The base was completed in June 2024. While he was wandering around the base, a player named [SwisherSurgeon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SwisherSurgeon) entered his visual range and took a world download, but did not leak it. After the base was fully completed, the famous Turkish YouTuber [Dogukanadal](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dogukanadal) made a video about it, and it became a hit among the Turkish community.

## 2B2T Turkic Community
A community called "2B2T Turkish Community" has been created to help Turks learn the game and help them. In this community, there are helpful guides and configs for Turkish players on many topics. Thanks to this community, it gathered the Turks under one roof and helped them.

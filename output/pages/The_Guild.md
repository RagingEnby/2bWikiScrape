**The Guild** was a group created by [SmackAttack86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SmackAttack86) and [OldFreeWilly](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/OldFreeWilly). The purpose of The Guild was to build a new spawn base every day and to have fun.

## History
Originally, The Guild was a group known to relatively few players. After certain internal plans did not come to fruition, SmackAttack86, a member of the group, left and sent messages to several remaining members that were perceived as threatening. SmackAttack86 later rejoined the original Guild to continue accessing internal information.

SmackAttack86 was under the impression that the original group had dissolved, SmackAttack86 established a new organization using The Guild name, potentially to leverage the existing recognition. This reincarnation of The Guild was led by OldFreeWilly, who worked closely with SmackAttack86. Supposedly, this clone group had been around a few months before it was made public, though evidence shows that this span of time was only 10 days. During this time it housed only a few members and no bases. When SmackAttack86's Guild became publicly known on October 1st, approximately 20 players sought membership, though many were suspected of being trolls or infiltrators. SmackAttack86 and OldFreeWilly thought up a plan to keep insiders in The Guild, but in a position where they could not do damage. They realized that if they flagged players who seemed suspicious and only sent them on petty tasks to retrieve items and deliver them to random coordinates and never promoted them, then they could waste the time of insiders, while giving them a false sense of belief that their attempt would be successful. Later though, Smack realized that this plan let in too many insiders and not enough loyal members so he scrapped the insider policy.

## Rank System
The default rank in The Guild's discord was Void. Void doesn't represent The Guild in any way and you only have access to #the-void which is just a general chat. People were initiated into The Guild via an interview with any Grandmaster ranked member.

## Relationships
The Guild were hated by many players and groups on 2b2t at the time, Smackattack86 would constantly start trouble with players from other groups which resulted on him getting tricked and bedtrapped by The [Asylum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Asylum) and the Emperium. OldFreeWilly's personal base would also be destroyed by the Asylum due to making enemies with them, leading to both OldFreeWilly and Smackattack86 to give up and disband The Guild.

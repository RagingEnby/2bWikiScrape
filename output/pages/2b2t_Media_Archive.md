The **2b2t Media Archive** was one of the largest 2b2t discord communities, with the main purpose of archiving all 2b2t related content, ranging from discord servers to YouTube channels. It had over 4500 members and over 150 discords archived. It also showcased other 2b2t community content such as websites, 2b2t subreddit posts, YouTube channels and videos, and Imgur albums.

## History
### Pre-Foundation
There had been a few attempts at making a 2b2t Archive before the 2b2t Media Archive. Initially, people used the Facepunch Forum Threads as archives, but they grew larger and became more difficult to read through. The [2b2t Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/) was founded in {{Date and age|2012|03|}}, and the 8chan board was founded around 2014. Reddit and 8chan became the most popular way for archiving info on 2b2t. 8chan eventually fell out of favor as threads are purged if they are inactive, and 8chan can't be found in google search results. There was an attempt at a [2b2t archive](https://gist.github.com/toobeetootee/ef415a0577a2e8522372) during early 2016, but died due to lack of updates. The 2b2t Archive Discord was opened by [xyzvp](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xyzvp) on {{Date and age|2018|02|7}}.

### Foundation and early Drama
During the Archive's first few weeks on discord, xyzvp was the sole manager. Early on there was a dispute over if the discord channels of popular youtubers (such as [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) and [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86)) should be added. While this vote ended in a no, xyzvp ended up adding these discords because "[it] would be discriminative / subjective, and this Discord was made for all 2b2t related servers regardless of its popularity". (Fits discord ended up being removed after the discord became private). A month later, the Archive was hit by a wave of spambots. xyzvp responded to this event by removing all invites from the server and locking invites to a certain role only (this role has been removed a few months after). He also hired three moderators to keep the main chat in order. These players were [Adriano1804](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Adriano1804), [Jonathan222](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jonathan222) (RandomPfP), and [Virl](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Virl). Spam drama became less of a problem. Overtime, Virl became the first admin of the 2b2t Media Archive.

### Mid/Late 2018 Additions
In the Summer of 2018, the 2b2t Media Archive expanded from only discords but channels, websites, streams, and photo albums as well. Minimum requirements were increased because of the amount of suggestions made daily (Factions went from 20 to 50). [Beardler](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Beardler), [Retronautx](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Retronautx), and [Uisanta](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Uisanta) (Beardler was demoted several days later after the [BoeMeccan Witch Trials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BoeMeccan_Witch_Trials)). The current administrators at the time, Adriano1804, Jonathan222, and Virl, received more permissions as an Administrator of the 2b2t Media Archive such as passing/adding rules and managing primary issues. On October 13th, 2018, the 2b2t Media Archive reached 500 members, which is only a fraction of the amount of members the discord had at its peak.

### 2019 Drama and Rapid Expansion
During early 2019, the 2b2t Media Archive started gaining around 33 players daily (800 -> 900 from March 2nd to March 5th). The 2b2t Media Archive hit 1000 members on March 11th, 2019. The infamous "Rule 8" (mentioning queue positions is prohibited) was added which disrupted the community.  On April 1st, 2019, the 2b2t Media Archive hosted an April fools competition in where [Team Rusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Rusher) and [Popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Popbob) teamed up to craft the [Super Weapon.](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Super_Weapons) It was up to you to support [Team Veteran](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Veteran) and [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) in order to stop them (by spamming your queue position in a channel). One random person would get priority queue after the event as an award for "helping [Team Veteran](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Veteran)". The event shortly ended and the April Fools channel was locked. On May 30th, 2019, the 2b2t Media Archive hit 2000 members, which was higher than most discord servers at the time. New staff members were hired such as Bella, and Scavenger/Nemac was promoted to Administrator. A Kahoot was planned (and finished), but this was ultimately canceled due to hosting issues. In June 2019, Rule 8 was removed from the rules. An increase in shop suggestions caused controversy. A scam took place on a shop that obtained members through the archive, leading to the shop's removal. All suggested shops are checked more often to prevent the same incident from occurring again. As of September 2019, the 2b2t Media Archive had over 4500 members.

### Death
On September 10th, 2020, the 2b2t Media Archive discord was nuked by [The_Grand_Lotus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Grand_Lotus), one of the moderators. After this, the [2b2t Discord Archive](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Discord_Archive) was quickly set up in its place by [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut), before being given to [Chipoff](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chipoff). Unlike the Media Archive, the Discord Archive only contains discord servers (with a minimum of 50 members instead of 100). Regardless, the Discord Archive has over 2,300 members as of January 2023.

### 2b2t Archive "Legacy Edition"
On September 15th, a [new Discord Server](https://discord.gg/bzgFA6a) was opened by the team at the 2b2t Archive. This archive was made to host links to the Discord servers that don't have the set requirements to be hosted on the original Archive anymore, the servers that probably will get the requirements in the future, and servers that have scammed and doxxed. This discord was not nuked along with the main Media Archive, but is largely inactive.

## 2b2t Video Archive
The 2b2t Video Archive YouTube channel was created on June 10th, 2018 by [DavidPrydain](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DavidPrydain). The channel hosts every video (organised by year) of 2b2t on YouTube. On April 4th, 2020, [DavidPrydain's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DavidPrydain) project partnered with the 2b2t Media Archive and he joined the staff team. Currently there have been over 6,000+ videos archived onto the 2b2t Video Archive channel. The Video Archive discord also archives videos that cannot be archived on YouTube or are deleted on YouTube.

## Archive Overview
The 2b2t Media Archive was broken up into multiple parts which organize content that was suggested in the archive. Common suggested discords included factions, large scale projects, and discords dedicated towards a certain player/player base. In order to prevent spam/irrelevant discords, many guidelines were created in order to filter out the relevant content. By default, discords that did not meet the requirements generally got deleted. Formerly, discords that did not meet the requirement would be redirected to a "waiting list" channel. However this was later removed.

### Projects
Not to be confused with the Archives useful section, the projects section contained discords that are exceptionally active. Discords that fall into this category have the highest priority and access to send messages in their own exclusive channel dedicated towards their discord. While there was no exact minimum requirement, these types of discords were rarely added. The 2b2t Media Archive hosted two projects, the Society Project and Operation Bedrock.

### Discords
The majority of suggested content to be archived are discords associated to 2b2t. Discords were placed at the top of the archive channels for viewing. There were several requirements put in place for discords.

**Factions -** Content that was related to any group/faction on 2b2t. Generally this excluded war/purge based discords to prevent drama. All factions that were suggested were required to have 100+ members (and at least some form of activity).

**Miscellaneous -** Discords that did not directly fit into the other sections, but were still associated with 2b2t. This mostly included meme discords, other archives (such as the Map Archive), and podcasts related to 2b2t. All discords that fit into this section had to have 100+ members.

**Users -** This section was for discords dedicated towards a player/playerbase. All user based discords were required to have 100+ members.

**Useful -** Content that was exceptionally important to the 2b2t community. This section contained discords such as the [2b2t Museum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Museum), and the [2b2t Anarchy Server Wiki](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Wiki) itself. While there was no set requirement, these type of discords were rarely added. Useful discords were generally active and had a large dedicated community. This section was not to be confused with the Projects section, which had its own standards and rules.

**Clients -** The majority of hacked clients can be found in this section. This contains clients that are commonly used (such as Impact and Future) alongside other custom clients dedicated towards 2b2t. While the minimum user requirement was low (20), the archive generally did not accept backdoored discords.

**Shops -** Items could be purchased in these discords. All shops were required to have 100+ members and no former history of scams/discontent (ex: items came exceptionally late, had problems with the seller). The majority of shops that were suggested were usually checked by the 2b2t Media Archive Admins to prevent possible scams.

### Media
This category was dedicated towards non discords, such as websites, articles, and channels. Unlike the discord section, there were no set requirements towards these other than it had to be related to 2b2t in some way.

**Subreddit -** All subreddit posts were archived in this channel (and can be partially viewed even if deleted). These posts were automatically added and players couldn't suggest Reddit posts to this section.

**Websites -** This section archived all websites containing information about 2b2t, ranging from guides, to articles on the server itself. During the Summer of 2019, many Taiwanese articles were archived in this channel and were available to the public.

**Subreddit List -** An inactive channel that redirected you the 2b2t subreddit.

**Channels -** Considered to be the most active section in the entire Archive itself, this archived all 2b2t related YouTube channels for public viewing. There was no set requirement on how to have your YouTube channel advertisement, so this was considered the easiest way to get some attention on YouTube from the 2b2t community.

**Imgur Albums -** This section contained all 2b2t Imgur albums. There was no set requirement to have your content added to this section.

**Other -**  A channel that hosted 2b2t media that doesn't fit into any other category.

### Removed/Archived Channels
These are channels that were removed/archived for various reasons. They have been organized by removal date.

**Waiting List -** Added during the Archives first days and removed in the Summer of 2018, any discord that didn't meet the requirements at the time were re-added in this channel until they meet the required amount of members to be added to a channel. The waiting list was removed.

**Banners -** Created in November 2018, despite being an active channel, this was removed for unknown reasons. Like the channel name, this channel was dedicated to archiving faction/group banners on the server

**Welcome -** Just as the name says, this channel records join/leave logs. This channel was archived in May 2019 and later became a private channel for staff members only. The reason why this was private - was also private.

**Old Information Channels* -** Archived versions of older information channels.

**2019 April Fools -** Originally "Free Priority Queue", this channel was created for the sole purpose of the April Fools event of 2019. This channel was added on April 1st 2019 and was archived sometime in June 2019.

**Diet Cancer -** Existing for a few days, this channel was added in July 2019 as a non-cancerous substitute to the existing main chat. This channel was removed due to lack of activity.

**Playlists -** Used previously to host 2b2t video playlists, but was archived when the 2b2t Video Archive was created which now hosts the playlists.

## Staff Members
The 2b2t Media Archive mostly consisted of Administrators and a few moderators. At various times, the owner gave "ownership" to an admin for a short period of time.

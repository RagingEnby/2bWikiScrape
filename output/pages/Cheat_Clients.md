{{Warning|The 2b2t Wiki is not responsible for your usage of any cheat client. You will most likely be banned on non-anarchy *Minecraft* servers for use of them. Use them at your own risk.}}

A *Minecraft* **client**, often known as a **hacked client**, **cheat client**, or **utility mod**, is a modification to the game which offer modules, also known as cheats or hacks. These features are not in the vanilla form, or default form, of *Minecraft*. No clients are affiliated with Mojang, similar to most mods.  As clients can give players an unfair advantage, the use of them is against the rules of most servers and will get users banned. On anarchy servers like [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t), however, using clients has been normalized, as most players use them.

Excluding new players, it is rare to find players who do not use clients, as they're needed for automating travel, PvP advantages, and generally improving quality of life.

## History on 2b2t
In early 2b2t, hacks were not as readily available to the public as they currently are. People would either code the early clients themselves or get them from friends or sketchy websites. While historically, clients were only used by a fraction of the player base, their usage has increased over time. [4channer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4channer) [Luke2thebun](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Luke2thebun) was one of the first known players to use a hacked client, who did so in early 2011. [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob) was also an infamous early user.

Many players used vanilla until after [TheCampingRusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) brought an [influx of players](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Rusher_War) to the server, causing the number of players using a client to gradually increase over time. Despite implicitly allowing cheating, 2b2t patches many cheats such as extremely fast movement hacks, to reduce lag on the server, but also patches vanilla things such as placing boats on land, while making vanilla Elytra flying and vanilla fishing less effective than normal, which are controversial topics on the server.

## List of 1.19 (or newer) clients on 2b2t
{{Notice|2b2t now supports connecting on many different versions of Minecraft, through the use of ViaVersion. Any version of Minecraft that is equal to 2b2t's version or newer should work fine.}}

### Popular clients
These are clients that are generally most common, they are oftentimes the most trusted although their inclusion on this website does not constitute an endorsement of their safety or utility.

*[Meteor](https://meteorclient.com/) - A free and open sourced client created by MineGame159 and seasnail, that is very popular amongst players, due to the fact that it supports the newest versions of Minecraft. It is also popular due to it being super easy to use, and being very customizable. The client also supports addons that can be downloaded online, but users can also make their own addons using the [template](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-addon-template/) found in their [github](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/).
*[RusherHack](https://rusherhack.org/) – Client made by [John200410](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/John200410), who also is the creator of [Rusherb0t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/RusherB0t) and [oldfag.org](https://oldfag.org/). RusherHack is a paid utility mod that costs $19.99 and has 1.12.2 - 1.20.1 support. It is heavily customizable, easy to use and navigate, and has [amazing utility and travel modules](https://youtu.be/Dg1BoHX7bJo?si=_NWv_u4cOiONe5Mq). "Cracked" clients or free version should be avoided, as they have a high chance of containing malicious software.
*[Future](https://www.futureclient.net/) – A paid client advertised by [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FitMC) and several other 2b2t YouTubers. It is a very popular client as a result, and is used by many. It has highly powerful PvP modules, but is more lacking for casual travelers, and has a basic GUI that can be called lacking. It currently costs 24.99 Euros. It is highly advised to avoid any "cracks" and other free versions, as they almost always have backdoors, and will probably steal your coordinates, tokens, and more.
*[Mio](https://mioclient.me/) - Originally private, Mio was created by Cattyyyn Mironov and Asphyxia for PVP and base hunting. It features powerful combat features, effective base-finding capabilities, and bypasses for 2b2t and Constantiam. Supporting versions 1.20.4 and 1.21.1, it offers a user-friendly and customizable experience. Use official versions for security and updates.

### Somewhat common clients
* [Shoreline](https://shorelineclient.net/) - Currently private however access can be bought for $250. Primarily a PVP client.

### Custom Clients
* StarHack - Client developed by [ANALP0RN](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ANALP0RN) following the servers update to 1.19 and GrimAC. It contained many bypasses for GrimAC aswell as a very unique HUD. It was based on a stripped version of SalHack.
* Anubis - Utility client developed by EBS. It was notably the first client for sale with an "Extended Rocket" module for GrimAC.

## List of 1.12.2 clients on 2b2t
{{Notice|Since 2b2t has updated to 1.19, the 1.12 clients are generally outdated. Most of them will still work, somewhat, on 2b2t, but you'll want a client that actually supports 1.19 or newer.}}
This section will discuss most of the used 1.12.2 clients on [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) and rank them based on their usage by the common player. Most of these are offered by the client's personal site.

### Popular clients
These are clients that are generally most common, and considered as the most trusted.
*[Lambda](https://github.com/lambda-client/lambda)- An open-source, therefore free, continuation of now discontinued KAMI Blue. It provides regular updates, and thanks to it being open-source, anyone can contribute. It features a stunningly visionary plugin system, allowing for hot-loading of plugins while in game, to allow for immense customization and quick changes, without reloading Minecraft. It has many advanced utility modules, and can be used for PvP as well, but is more geared towards more casual players.
*[Future](https://www.futureclient.net/) – A paid client advertised by [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FitMC) and several other 2b2t YouTubers. It is a very popular client as a result, and is used by many. It has highly powerful PvP modules, but is more lacking for casual travelers, and has a basic GUI that can be called lacking. It currently costs 24.99 Euros. It is highly advised to avoid any "cracks" and other free versions, as they almost always have backdoors, and will probably steal your coordinates, tokens, and more.
*[Rusherhack](https://rusherhack.org/) – Client made by [John200410](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/John200410), who also is the creator of [Rusherb0t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/RusherB0t) and [oldfag.org](https://oldfag.org/index.html). Rusherhack currently costs $20. However, for an additional $100, or 5 referrals, you can receive Rusherhack Plus, which features brand new exploits and other fancy modules before they reach the normal userbase. It has a heavily customizable GUI, is generally easy to use and navigate, and has amazing utility and travel modules. It has the fastest Elytra fly exploit as of now, at around 420km/h for normal users, and 720km/h for Plus users. It is more lacking in the PvP department, however. "Cracked" clients should be avoided, as they may contain malicious software.

### Somewhat common clients
*[Impact](https://impactclient.net/) – Impact is a free, closed source, client, and was one of the first to integrate Baritone functionality, an AI pathfinding bot that can navigate. It was made well known during the [Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Rusher_War) after Rusher's advertisement and through eventually use of many 2b2t YouTubers. It has seen much use, however has not been updated since around 2021, and has become outdated. Many of its modules have stopped functioning on 2b2t, due to the evolving anticheat, but many casual players still can make good use of it thanks to an easy to use GUI, and easily configurable modules.

*[Konas](https://konasclient.com/) – A paid client developed by GL_DONT_CARE, Darki, and Auto, released in 2020. The current price of Konas is $15. It is a client that had many 2b2t bypasses, and an excellent crystal aura, but has not received an update since mid 2021, so as a result many of its functions and bypasses do not function as intended. Avoid "cracks"/free versions if you want to not have viruses on your pc.

### Uncommon hacked clients
*[Inertia](https://inertiaclient.com/) – A free utility mod with over 470 thousand downloads, featuring advanced combat and render modules. Formerly known as WWE Client, the name was changed due to DMCA infringement.

*[SalHack](https://salhack.com) – A client made by Ionar2 went open-source due to the unobfuscated jar being leaked. Currently has no developers and the Discord does not provide technical support for Salhack either.

*[Wurst+3](https://github.com/TrvsF/wurst-plus-three) - The newest version of the client, open-source on Github, developed by [TrvsF](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TrvsF) and [Madmeg](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Madmeg).

*[ForgeHax](https://github.com/fr1kin/ForgeHax) – An open-source Forge mod with a power user feel to it. It lacks a useful GUI and is configured with only commands. ForgeHax became popular thanks to its book writer for creating ban books/dupe books.

{{Backdoors}}

* Phobos - formerly backdoored client with versions 1.3 and 1.5.4 having contained backdoors. Phobos 1.3 contained a coordinate logger, and Phobos 1.5.4 contained a Remote Access Trojan (RAT), which uploaded the user's Minecraft passwords, Discord token, Chrome passwords, desktop screenshots, and computer files to a remote server. Coordinates to many bases were obtained and leaked, and the developers had access to personal information. More information: [Phobos Incident](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Phobos_Incident)
* Kinodupe - Client that only existed for 6 whole days during the 11/11 dupe. Its only purpose was to make duping easier during the 11/11 dupe. However, using this client would leak your coords, and the resulting spreadsheet was eventually posted publicly resulting in many griefs. Many players however took advantage of this fact and duped in random locations.
* Adolf - An early hacked client by [x0XP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/x0XP), would steal your coords. Cause of Valkyria coordinates being leaked.

* Sigma - A client developed by OmikronClient and LeakedPVP mainly used for pvp servers and although not very common on 2b2t there were some videos made featuring that client on 2b. it was later discovered that the client (Sigma5) had a Bitcoin miner and a RAT and possibly a token logger.

### Other clients
Other clients can be found in the [2b2t Discord Archive](https://discord.gg/gDCRNaD).

## Installing Your Hacked Client
{{Warning|If your computer knowledge goes as far as clicking radio buttons and pressing, "Install", in the installation wizard, take extra precautions when performing installations, or refrain from installing anything at all.}}
{{Warning|Do not, under any circumstances, open any links, let alone client download links, that were posted by someone in the 2b2t server chat, or in unaffiliated Discord servers. 2b2t is an anarchy server, do not trust anybody that you do not know.}}

# **Choose your desired hack client.** There are many clients a player can choose from. Many of the most popular and safe ones can be found [here](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cheat_Clients#Popular_clients).
#**Download your desired hacked client.** This is one of the riskiest steps of the installation process. The reason that this is risky is that you may not be installing the hacked client you chose, but rather another program that could be malware or be backdoored. Therefore, you should **<u>click the links on this page; do not try and find the client's official website on your own through Google or Discord</u>**. If you download through the hacked client's website, it will most likely take you through ad.fly or another website of the same function. These websites allow the creators of the hacked client to earn some money by displaying advertisements to those who download it. Forge and OptiFine also do this. These websites can display ads and popups that lead to malicious downloads or can be 'tech support scams'. Generally, do not click on or interact with any popups or notification boxes, just look for the 'Skip Ad' button so you can be taken to the download page back on the original site. Unless you have an ad block program (which doesn't completely protect you from risk), it could be safer to ask a friend or trusted person to send you the installer or a link to the official download page of the hacked client.
# If the download you received was a .exe, .jar file, or other executable, you can double click to run it and it will guide you through the installation process. You may need to [install Java](https://java.com/en/download/) and/or bypass Windows Defender (more info, run anyway).
#Otherwise, if the download is a .zip file: unzip the file, go to the .minecraft folder (in the hidden %appdata% folder) and transfer the contents of the unzipped folder into the versions folder.
#Once you have done that, open your Minecraft launcher, and make a new profile. Depending on the client, it may require to be named a specific name: i.e. 313hax (Impact)). Now simply change the Minecraft version to the one with the hacked client name next to it and you are good to go.

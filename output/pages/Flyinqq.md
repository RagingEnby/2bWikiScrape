**Flyinqq** is a [midfag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/midfag) known for his involvement in the development of multiple exploits and cheat clients.
## History
**Flyinqq** joined the server on December 25th 2015, joining through the r/minecraft Reddit after seeing a post of one of the Christmas trees built at Spawn. He did not attain any significance until [The Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Rusher_War), where he was a significant [Spawnfag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnfags). On January 3rd 2017, [Crystallising](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crystallising) and Flyinqq founded a group known as [Team Coca Cola](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Coca_Cola). Flyinqq was one of the two people with access to a very limited exploit where if another player messaged Flyinqq while entering a nether portal, Flyinqq would gain coordinates to the exit portal that they come out to, this was patched shortly before [AntVenom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AntVenom) made his first 2b2t video. He was also one of the few people with access to a Nether Roof Exploit in 2017. Flyinqq based at [Shelter 404](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shelter_404) with the other members of [Team Coca Cola](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Coca_Cola), including [Crystallising](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crystallising), [Niftyrobo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Niftyrobo), [CainesLaw](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CainesLaw), [Colette3211](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Colette3211), [xvideosman](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xvideosman), [BarrenDome](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BarrenDome), [TheCookCola](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCookCola), [DemonCrown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DemonCrown), [HappinessBot](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HappinessBot), [XZRC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/XZRC), and [MiningMinecraft](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MiningMinecraft). He founded [Team Malaria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Malaria), and joined [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium), [Team Imperia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Imperia), [Infinity Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinity_Incursion), participated in [the Bakery's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Bakery) chunkban exploit, and temporarily brought back [Peacekeepeers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Peacekeepers) with some of the other older members in 2019. When [086](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/086) began development on the [Root Client](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cheat_Clients), Flyinqq helped him extensively in tuning the client's [auto-crystal](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Combat).

Collecting is one of the more common activities on 2b2t. Player’s have collected a wide variety of items throughout the years, ranging from normal blocks to blocks that were obtained through backdoors or exploits. Many items are considered a ‘collectible’, although their history, value and rarity vary greatly. Some of these items are even exclusive to 2b2t, as some of them have never been seen on any other Minecraft server, which enhances [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t)'s uniqueness. Many players are also not aware of their differences and collectively describe these items as ‘rare’, ‘glitched’ or ‘hacked in’. Different categories of ‘collectibles’ can be distuingished. Interest in 'collecting' often overlaps with interests in the 'technical' side of Minecraft.

## Oddities
‘Oddities’ consist of normal Minecraft items, which are still obtainable. They are easily obtainable, reproducible and overall just considered an ‘oddity’ to collect. These include:
*[Chainmail armor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chainmail_armor) pieces: Chainmail armor was one of the five armor sets introduced in the early versions of Minecraft. Its protection value was between iron and gold and the pieces were not very durable. On top of that the sets couldn’t be crafted in survival, because they required ‘fire’ blocks which were impossible to obtain. The developers of Minecraft didn’t pay too much attention to the chainmail armor until 2012, when it became possible to obtain individual chainmail pieces through trading and killing mobs. This was also the case on 2b2t, where just like on other servers it was considered a challenge to obtain every single armor piece, especially if the pieces had not lost any durability and were enchanted. Ever since [duplication exploits](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/duplication_exploits) such as the [Minecart Portal Dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Minecart_Portal_Dupe) of 2013 fully enchanted sets of chainmail armor became widespread and lost most of their rarity, a phenomenon relatively unique to 2b2t.
* Enchantment books
*Naturally generated banners
* Music discs
* Enchanted pumpkins
* Cakes
* Dyed armor sets
* Map id’s
* Mob heads.
The Dragon Egg also belongs to this category. Although it is arguably the most rare item in a normal Minecraft world, it has become extremely common due to it being duplicated.

## Unobtainable items
Unobtainable items’ consist of Minecraft items or mobs which at some point in the past were craftable or obtainable in the game, but can no longer be obtained due to changes in Minecraft itself or server plugins. They are often not necessarily rare due to being duplicated a lot, but are not reproducible. Some items disappeared when the server updated to Java Edition 1.19.4 in August 2023. The category includes items such as:
*[Alpha slabs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Alpha_slabs)
*[Alpha Leaves](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Alpha_Leaves)
*[Silk Touch Shears](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Silk_Touch_Shears)
*[No Flight Duration Fireworks](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/No_Flight_Duration_Fireworks)
*[Infinity-Mending Bows](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinity-Mending_Bows)
*[Double Protection helmets](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Double_Protection_helmets)
*[Altered NBT-tag items](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Altered_NBT-tag_items), including glass, golden apples, totems, End Crystals, Wither heads, XP-bottles and TNT
*Skeleton Horses with up to 26 health hearts
*Furnaces containing mushroom blocks in their fuel slots
*Cobblestone or Mossy Walls containing empty spaces
*Floating ladders
*Endermen holding snowy grass blocks
*Enderman holding netherrack (impossible after 1.16)
* Armor stands containing shield
* Armor stands containing Jack o'Lanterns or enchanted Jack o'Lanterns (possible only in 1.19.4)
* Jack o'Lanterns enchanted with curse of vanishing, curse of binding or both enchantments (impossible after 1.19.4)

## Glitched items
‘Glitched items’, consist of items that were obtained using exploits and glitches that were later patched. These include:
*Max enchanted books
*Stacked’ items - created during the Crafting Dupe.
*Negative durability items
*[Unbreakables](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Unbreakables)
*The ‘invisible’ block-36
*Floating gravity-blocks
*32k Signed Books - created by adding the following string into a written book and then signing it. **"storedEnchantments": [{"id": 16, "lvl": 32767}]".** Used by [Fr1kin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fr1kin) and [x0XP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/x0XP) in 2012.
*Non-enchanted enchantment book: Also possibly created using book-related exploits.

These items often need special treatment to stay in existence, due to server plugins automatically removing them if interacted with. ‘Illegals’ were permanently removed from the server in August 2023. The community interested in these items overlap with a Minecraft community that is overall interested in ‘discontinued features’ in Minecraft.

## Hacked-in items
‘Hacked-in items’ consists of Minecraft items which could only be introduced to the game by a player having admin-powers. Players like iTristan, popbob and Pyrobyte used their backdoors to spawn ‘hacked items’. Over time most of these have been removed from the server.
* Bedrock: Created during all three backdoors. Distributed to and duped at [omaliymix](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/omaliymix) and [CreamOfTheSlop](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CreamOfTheSlop)'s dupe stashes. Bedrock structures have been destroyed using exploits over time during events such has The Breakery.
* End Portal Frames: Created during the [First Backdoor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/First_Backdoor). Also distributed to and duped at [omaliymix](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/omaliymix) and [CreamOfTheSlop](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CreamOfTheSlop)'s dupe stashes. Many 'illegal' End portals have been found and destroyed over time. Most were deleted by Hausemaster, but a few remain in remote places.
* [Pig Spawners](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pig_Spawners): Spawned in by [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob) during the [First Backdoor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/First_Backdoor). Also distributed to and duped at [omaliymix](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/omaliymix) and [CreamOfTheSlop](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CreamOfTheSlop)'s dupe stashes. Become deleted if in inventory or viewed. All placed pig spawners were removed by [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) during the [1.12 Update](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/1.12_Update). They made a resurgence along with [Super Weapons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Super_Weapons), but were later patched again. Completely removed with the 1.19.4 update.
*[Command Blocks](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Command_Blocks). Created during the [Second Backdoor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Second_Backdoor), but they were unusable and couldn't be placed by anyone except for Pyrobyte, who experimented with tick speed in a bygone stash 2,000,000 blocks away from Spawn. The sole physical proof of their use is in the square ocean generated around it, as the borders used to be filled with an unusually large amount of mobs and Endermen activity.
*Locked chests: Created during the first [Backdoor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backdoor). Also distributed to and duped at [omaliymix](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/omaliymix) and [CreamOfTheSlop](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CreamOfTheSlop)'s dupe stashes. Deleted by Mojang in the 1.7.2 update.
* [Barrier Blocks](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Barrier_Blocks). Created during the Second and/or Third Backdoor and found in iTristan's stash in early 2017. According to [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa), 2 barriers blocks were placed on the [+X Highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highways) on the way to iTristan illegal stash. One was present at [Aureus City](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Aureus_City).
* Player heads: Originally spawned in during the [Second Backdoor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Second_Backdoor), later heads were spawned in by [The Tyranny](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc) in early 2016. Disabled by [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) along with some other items during the 1.12 server update. Completely removed with the 1.19.4 update.
* Stacked armor: Spawned during the [Second Backdoor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Second_Backdoor). Unstacked automatically while in inventory or viewed by player since the [1.12.2 Update](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/1.12.2_Update) Completely removed with the 1.19.4 update.
*[Max-enchanted gear](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/32K_Weapons), commonly known as '32ks' or 'Superweapons'. Created during the Second Backdoor and later reacquired by [Kinorana](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kinorana) and [AlphaComputer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlphaComputer). Patched multiple times and completely removed since 1.19.4 update.
* Spawn Eggs: Created during the First and Second [Backdoor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backdoor), also distributed to and duped at [omaliymix](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/omaliymix) and [CreamOfTheSlop](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CreamOfTheSlop)'s dupe stashes. It is also believed that [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) gave them to players in 2011.
*[Seamless Double Stone Slabs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Seamless_Double_Stone_Slabs)
* [Alpha Snowballs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Alpha_Snowballs)
* [Textureless Iron Horse Armor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Textureless_Iron_Horse_Armor)
* Barrier blocks
* Water blocks: Created by [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob) during the [First Backdoor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/First_Backdoor). Also distributed to and duped at [omaliymix](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/omaliymix) and [CreamOfTheSlop](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CreamOfTheSlop)'s dupe stashes. Deleted by Mojang in the 1.8 update.
* Fire blocks.
* [Shrubs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shrubs)
*Enchanted glass: Likely created during the Second backdoor. There were originally two sets: a glass block set - which became widely spread - and a glass pane set, which has been lost over time. These blocks 'reverted' since the 1.12.2 update and completely removed since the 1.19.4 update. Reverted enchanted glass still contains double NBT-tags, one for their custom name and one for their 'repair cost'.https://youtu.be/uru5HtD3SsA?t=3766
*Books with the copy status ‘tattered
*[Infinite blocks](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinite_blocks): Blocks that could be held and placed an infinite number of times. Originally discovered and utilized by the players at [ZiggyBase](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ZiggyBase). Deleted by Mojang along with all other negative items.

## Written books
Books are unique in the sense that they are connected to specific IGN’s. If a player keeps a book to himself, it could remain a truly unique and rare item. It became common for players to collect books and over time an entire subculture revolving around collecting, sharing and trading them developed. Known books include ‘jared2013’s diary’ or a book Etika wrote for FitMC.

## Custom collectibles
‘Custom Collectibles’ consist of items that are ‘created’ by players but impossible to differentiate from potential replicas or copies. This category includes the wide variety of banners players have created over the years. Banners can easily be copied and their crafting recipes are often public. ‘Blocks’ that Players have created themselves or collected or obtained from old base ruins or other prominent locations, also belong to this category. An example of that is the Rusher shield FitMC obtained from [TheCampingRusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher). Map-arts and ‘kits’ related to players or groups also belong to this category.

## 1.12 Patching of Illegals
Prior to the server's update in 2017, u/2builders2tools would post making their intention to patch illegals upon the server's update to 1.12 known. After the update, players would notice upon joining that their illegal items were still there. However this would be short lived as after roughly one hour the anti-illegals patch went into effect. This patch made it so any time a player opened an inventory containing illegals, the illegals would either revert to their vanilla form or be "deleted" in a few seconds. Notably this patch did not affect alpha slabs, leaves, snowballs, and horse armor.

## Post-Patch Illegal Usage
Soon after the patch players would discover that by using a hopper players could not only interact but also use [32k swords](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/32K_Weapons), pig spawners, and other illegal items. Notably this would allow the continued use of both [32k swords](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/32K_Weapons) and pig spawners.  However this would soon be patched as the anti-illegals patch would be adjusted to make it so anytime players loaded a chunk with either 32k swords or pig spawners in any inventory they would revert or be "deleted".

## Modern State of Illegals on 2b2t
Upon 2b2t's update to 1.19 the patch notes found on [2b2t.org](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t.org) clarified the following, "All items with illegitimate values for durability, enchants, or stack sizes have been removed."

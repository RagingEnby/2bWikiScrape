**Invictus** was a base group created in 2016 as a result of the influx of players from [TheCampingRusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher)'s video series. It later served as one of the main sources of members for [Block Game Mecca](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Mecca) following its disbandment.
## History
### Formation
[Vertrix](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vertrix) and a player called "Russian" founded the group and created the initial base, which they called Invictus. After realizing that both of them had had prior building experience, they decided they would only recruit others with this same skillset and mindset. While this was more a guideline than a rule, many players subsequently joined the group.

### Invictus I
After founding Invictus I (then, simply called Invictus), Vertrix and Russian started recruiting. The first players recruited left quickly; there were serious issues with player retention. Some of the first players to stay were named [Fogel_2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fogel_2) and [Screams](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Screams). Russian disappeared from the server, so Fogel_2 took over his role as co-leader. Screams and Vertrix met [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids) independently of eachother, and both invited and vouched for him. Slappnbadkids then invited [Juicybear](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Juicybear), [b3astplay3r](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/b3astplay3r), [TechReadyGamer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TechReadyGamer), [TaurusBabe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TaurusBabe), [chairman_112](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/chairman_112), [PhantomSB](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/PhantomSB), and [GetDroppedKids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/GetDroppedKids). GetDroppedKids invited [Donster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donster) to the base without telling any of the other members. Donster began sending messages to Vertrix, using the account JaredIsKing, describing things about the base that only someone who had seen it would know. Out of fear their base might be discovered, the base was self-griefed and GetDroppedKids was kicked. The group moved to a new location.

### Invictus II
The leadership in the group shifted following the move to being Vertrix, Slappnbadkids, and b3stplay3r. The group began to work on Invictus II (sometimes called Autismbot's 1Mil Base), and the base was progressing steadily. [Drathader](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Drathader), [Sophrosyne](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sophrosyne), [TooMuchAdvil](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TooMuchAdvil), [TCOJC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TCOJC), and [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) were invited around this time.

Slappnbadkids was experimenting with the [BedTP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BedTP) exploit, when he accidentally discovered the bedchain to [La Rosa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/La_Rosa), which the group looted. Many of the base's members had left 2b2t in favor of [Constantiam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Constantiam), and they'd left references to this at the base's signboard, causing the base to be spared from a grief at first. Slappnbadkids later found that [C4RTM4N](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/C4RTM4N) still based there and was unhappy about the removal of the base's materials. He made this known, alerting the Invictus group to the fact that La Rosa was very much still active. As a result, Slappnbadkids decided to grief the base for the name recognition and notoriety.

Chairman_112 insided [NedaT](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NedaT)'s faction, [Team Aurora](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Aurora). In light of this, NedaT was invited to Invictus II to do a base tour and to 1 v 1 chairman_112, following the leak of the base by a new member, [PhantomOf2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/PhantomOf2b2t). [Mines](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mines) also did a tour . The base lasted until late September 2016. As the base was only leaked and not raided, the group moved to save the items. The issue was no one knew who leaked the base immediately, so about half of the group consisting of Slappnbadkids, Vertrix, b3astslay3r, Drathader, Sophrosyne, and Joey_Coconut took all the items and stashed them several thousand blocks away for safekeeping. Once it was determined that PhantomOf2b2t was the leaker, what was left of the group reassembled, and determined it was time to move. Many members of the group subsequently quit 2b2t.

### Obliviscaris
Obliviscaris was founded soon thereafter, although it did not last long. Slappnbadkids' association with the [4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4th_Reich) and his dislike of NedaT caused TechReadyGamer to leak the base after only a few weeks. TechReadyGamer then quit the server. The base lasted less than 2 weeks, and had only just begun to take shape when the grief happened.

### Disbandment
The grief of Obliviscaris was demoralizing to the Invictus Group as a whole as much of the group's materials were lost, and a core member from very early in the group had betrayed them. This Several members quit 2b2t, several more took extended breaks, a few decided to go out on their own, and the rest were invited to C4RTM4N's [2b2t Creative Mode Project](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Creative_Mode_Project). All of the members of the Invictus Group that remained on the server were eventually later invited to [Block Game Mecca](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Mecca), where they formed a major portion of the group's members alongside those from [Eastmarch](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Eastmarch) and the various other participants in the base.

## History
[NedaT](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NedaT) founded Team Aurora in early September 2016 after being kicked from the [Resistance](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Resistance). She began recruiting people such as [Faroaman](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Faroaman), [Chloe2k15](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chloe2k15), and [PandaMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/PandaMC), who was kicked out of the [Peacekeepers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Peacekeepers). Later inviting her Resistance comrade [PvP_Comboz](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/PvP_Comboz), as well as [Brayin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Brayin). The group mainly focused on killing newfags at spawn as well as pvping with other groups, resulting in NedaT having multiple video appearances with [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit). The group was initially close to [TheJadhya](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheJadhya), due to his and NedaT’s friendship, but later distanced themselves from him and the [Guardian Rusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardian_Rushers) following criticism.

## Post-War
During the last days of the [Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rusher_War), Team Aurora began to focus their attention on the [4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_4th_Reich) due to a grudge [NedaT](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NedaT) had against them during her time with the Resistance. The two groups began griefing each other, resulting in a fight taking place at Fit’s Post War party event. The groups continued this, eventually dragging the [Peacekeepers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Peacekeepers) in,  resulting in the [Three Way Conflict](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Three_Way_Conflict) that lasted until the end of the [Fifth Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Incursion).

## [Team Rainbow](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Rainbow)
In August of 2017, [Brayin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Brayin) alongside his friend, [Da99thWolf](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Da99thWolf) created [Team Rainbow](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Rainbow) after Team Aurora had slowly become dormant. Most of the still active members would transition over to the group.

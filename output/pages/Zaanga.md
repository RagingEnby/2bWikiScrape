**Zaanga** is a builder and digger that joined in 2016, built at [Hopen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hopen), and helped to lead the [+X Nether Border Diggers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/%2BX_Nether_Border_Diggers).

## History
### Base Building
Zaanga joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) in 2016 as a result of [TheCampingRusher's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) video. After failing to escape spawn, he left for an extended period, returning in late 2019 as a result of [FitMC's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) channel reaching him on YouTube. After spending several months exploring the greater [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn) region, he befriended [FamilyPumpkin6](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FamilyPumpkin6), who invited him to [Hopen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hopen). While at Hopen, Zaanga built his acacia town near the main desert section of the base. Following Hopen's grief in August 2020, Zaanga was invited to [Block Game Jerusalem](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Jerusalem) with most of the other base members. He was inactive most of his time there although he built a totemist village towards the end of the base's lifespan. He also built at [Chunk Haven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chunk_Haven) and [Sky](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sky) during a stint as a guest in the [Spawnmasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons).
### Nether Border Dig
While at Hopen, Zaanga co-founded the [+X Nether Border Diggers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/%2BX_Nether_Border_Diggers) with FamilyPumpkin6. He co-led the group and later assumed full leadership of the project when FamilyPumpkin6 took an extended break from 2b2t. The +X Nether Border Diggers reached the nether border on 22 June, 2021.

## History
### Early History
I_tri joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) as a result of quarantine after finding the about the server from youtube. He joined on May 13th 2020, and shortly thereafter joined the [New Facepunch Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/New_Facepunch_Republic) through a link in global chat. He was invited to Fort Hardware and Software which was his home until it was greifed a week later. After the fall of Fort Hardware and Software he joined the NFPR-affiliated base group [Corinth](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Corinth). After joining Corinth, he went exploring old base ruins. During his travels he came upon [Spawn Train](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Train) and a [Base Nostalgia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Base_Nostalgia) rebuild. When he found the Base Nostalgia Rebuild he met [Y_a_t_a](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Y_a_t_a) who introduced I_tri to some of his friends such as [b0dait](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/b0dait), [Hurtmercury](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hurtmercury), and [fierceben](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fierceben).

### Crimson Star
After meeting Y_a_t_a and Hurtmercury, I_tri became an early member of [Crimson Star](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crimson_Star), soon becoming an admin in the group. I_tri helped with the construction of [Cum Zone](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crimson_Star#Cum_Zone) and [Cum Zone II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cum_Zone_II), meeting [bread_loafs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/bread_loafs) in the process. With the advent of the [10th Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/10th_Incursion), I_tri duped materials using the [Pyro dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dupes#Pyro_dupe) for it at the base. Crimson dissolved as a result of drama within the managment, largely over fierceben's inactivity. Following the dissolution of Crimson Star, I_tri founded the meme group [WE_TRI](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/WE_TRI), and also joined [Fate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fate) and [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate) with most of the other former Crimson members.

### SBC, Fate, and Guardsmen
After joining the Shortbus Caliphate, I_tri participated in a number of SBC and SBC-affiliated bases, such as [The Calculator](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate#The_Calculators), [The Calculator 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate#The_Calculators), and [Gaza](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate#Gaza).  He was also invited to other projects with many SBC members, such as [The Autumn Drain](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Autumn_Drain) and [Camp Spooky](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen#Camp_Spooky). He also was invited to [Halicarnassus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Halicarnassus), where he built his Desert Towers. Shortly after he was promoted in [Fate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fate) which allowed him to go to [Acropolis](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fate) and [Lateott](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fate), he was also invited by [VillagerFilms](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/VillagerFilms) to help out in the NFE 2020 rebuild. After the NFE rebuild concluded he was invited to the [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen), with whom he participated in a number of bases, such as [Adamantium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Adamantium), [Whistler](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen#Whistler), [Mediano](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen#Mediano), [Canopy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen#Canopy), [The Homeland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen#The_Homeland), [The Crypt](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen#The_Crypt). He became a full member of the group after participating several months, and left the group with most of the other SBC members in October 2021.

### Astral Brotherhood
In August of 2021 I_tri was invited by [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) to the nascent [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) along with a variety of other players. I_tri co-founded the group's first base, [Vega](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Vega), with Joey_Coconut. I_tri became one of the most active members of the group, achieving the rank of Solarium and participating in many of the group's projects, such as [Menegroth](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Formative_bases). He built at a variety of other bases with the group before going inactive in late 2022.

Team WAO (pronounced "team way-oh"), short for Team WomenAreObjects, was a griefing and PvP group owned by [WomenAreObjects](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/WomenAreObjects). The Group has undergone 4 different phases, each of which had a number of different and same members.
#### History
In February 2020, a version of the Donkey Dupe involving end portals was leaked to Team WAO. They leaked the dupe, resulting in its patch. During the Battle of Ziggy Town on August 20, 2020, alongside Team WAO, the Anti Bedrock Society (a sub-group of [Armorsmith's Followers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith%27s_Followers)) was able to destroy the last block of the Bedrock Comet, after defeating the Klansmen. In August 2020, Team Wao participated in the last big team fight of the summer of 2020 against the infinity incursion, in which Team Wao won the battle. In October 2020, Team WAO griefed the [Tenth Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tenth_Incursion) skybase above the [Valley of Wheat](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valley_of_Wheat) following [the cancellation of MrBeast's 2b2t video](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tenth_Incursion#Cancellation_of_video_and_end_of_phase). They were later involved in patrolling the Nether Hub for the [second phase](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tenth_Incursion#Anti-Spawn_PvP_Phase) of the Incursion. In December of 2020 into January of 2021, Team Wao built a spawn monument known as "The Valley of Weed", known Crystal PvPer and Team Wao member 3pound, gave the name to the monument. Player "orsond" blew up part of the monument, the reason being is lost to time.

Later in October, Team Wao received coordinates to many bases provided by Phobos client developer Megyn shortly after the [Phobos backdoor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Phobos_backdoor), which they griefed. Eventually, Team WAO griefed the second [Lost Nomad Games](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lost_Nomad_Games) in early 2021 and were in conflict with [The Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium) up until it disbanded.

Team WAO returned to activity in late 2023, following the 1.19 Update. From February 2024 to June 2024, there were heated battles with [The Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium) over control of Nether 0, 0. Team WAO is generally considered to have come out victorious, though after this conflict Team WAO essentially disbanded due to changes in the PvP meta.

The group is known to fade in and out of relevancy as it constantly disbands and reboots again. Team WAO is inactive at the time of writing.

}}**Don Maximus** was a large [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) base founded by [Max1mumChr1s](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Max1mumChr1s) and [Traveeseemo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Traveeseemo).

## History
At the end of March 2023, after some significant changes in Donfuer's security measures, Max1mumChr1s was put in charge of his own mid-rank [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) base. He worked together with Traveeseemo to choose a location far enough away from spawn that they would feel safe. They wanted a location that had a diverse grouping of biomes so they could have a lot of diversity of build styles at the base.

When the base began, the two main areas that were quickly worked on were the classic medieval area and a western themed area that Traveeseemo built. Max1mumChr1s added a UFO flying above the Western Area to complete it. The members expanded the medieval area to include a large village with many houses that Traveeseemo and [D_loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_loaded) built, as well as several larger houses that Max1mumChr1s built. A large castle was constructed by Max1mumChr1s and [knullsidor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/knullsidor), and WalnutLikesPine built a large tower on the hill next to the river and a large church as well.

[Godroster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Godroster) was invited to the base, and he constructed one of his classic "Cookie Shacks" at the base. This gave Max1mumChr1s the idea to construct a Sandstone area of the base next to this cookie shack.

The base continued to expand, with a dock area that was constructed by Max1mumChr1s and knullsidor, and several large boats that were built in the swamp by members of the base. [Senko_Foxx](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Senko_Foxx) constructed the massive farm area in the south of the base, with a large obsidian pyramid and a massive temple-style build. VaydenPayne built another village area of the base in the southern side near Senko's farm, and many small and medium builds were constructed to connect the various areas of the base.

Max1mumChr1s and D_loaded built a small modern area of the base with several large towers in it.

Other builders in Donfuer were invited to the base and contributed to it, adding large and small builds of their own styles.

Many members of Donfuer used Don Maximus as a place to experiment with different building styles so they could grow as builders.

During the time of the base's construction, Max1mumChr1s invited many members of other groups to the base including the [WaterWay Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/WaterWay_Union), [Spectrum Builders](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spectrum_Builders), [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association), [The Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Imperials), and others. This was in an effort to improve relationships with other groups who had a somewhat negative view of Donfuer.

Max1mumChr1s also hosted a 6-Month Anniversary event at the base for the WaterWay Union. For the event, Max1mumCh1s constructed a full scale replica of the [Southern Canal](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Southern_Canal) at the base, complete with infrastructure that was being built on the canal such as water spouts and bridges. This event saw many trusted members of the WaterWay Union visit, as well as building their own builds at the base.

### Destruction & Aftermath
In the beginning of July 2023, [Teutonic Order](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Teutonic_Order) arrived at the base in the early hours of the day. Only [Muskwizard](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Muskwizard) was online when they showed up. They griefed the base to a crater, and the building stash was stolen by [Xsupergo08](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Xsupergo08).

After the griefing of Don Maximus, members of the base began to debate who had leaked the base to Teutonic Order. Max1mumChr1s began to have many issues with [Ko8efanboy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ko8efanboy) following the grief, accusing him of being responsible for the leak. Max1mumChr1s subsequently leaked one of Ko8efanboy's stashes publicly, after which, he was demoted in DonFuer.

Nearly every member of Don Maximus that remained in Donfuer became a high-ranking member of the group.

## Builds and Architecture
There were many large and significant builds constructed at Don Maximus. Some of the more notable builds included the large centerpiece castle that was constructed by [Knullsidor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Knullsidor), and [Max1mumChr1s](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Max1mumChr1s). This was hand designed by Knullsidor and was built by both Max1mumChr1s and Knullsidor.

There was also the Large Pyramid that was built by [Senko Foxx](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Senko_Foxx). This Pyramid was constructed completely out of obsidian, and then covered in stone brick, and it had a massive maze built within it with many hidden rooms throughout. Next to this pyramid was constructed a very large farm area with a Large Standing Temple that could be seen above all the other builds around it.

[WalnutLikesPine](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/WalnutLikesPine) constructed a massive Church at the base which would be actually cause some drama with base members since it was facing away from the center of the base instead of towards it.

Additionally, Knullsidor constructed "The Temple of the Sea Lantern" in the Swamp area of the base. This massive build was Knullsidor and Max1mumChr1s' passion project as they had an inside joke about it.

Max1mumChr1s spent a week carving a canal from one end of the base to the other on the northern end of the base through the Mesa Biome from the swamp to the desert. This replica of the canal was full scale matching the size, depth, and design of the Southern Canal.

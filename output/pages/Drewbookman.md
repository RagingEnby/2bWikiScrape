## Drama
*See also: [Anatolia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Anatolia)*

One of the oldest continuous dramas/feuds on 2b2t is one concerning two past basemates: [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86) and Drewbookman. The drama is about the grief of [Anatolia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Anatolia). The base was griefed by [Pyrobyte](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pyrobyte) so that Sato86 and Pyrobyte could frame Drewbookman for the grief. This was done in response to Drewbookman wanting to claim the base for himself and him griefing parts of [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria_(Base)).

## History
### Construction
New Menegroth was founded on April 29, 2023 by [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut), [LordGalvatronMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/LordGalvatronMC), and [smcz19](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/smcz19) as the main base of the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) following the self-grief of [Dubrovnik](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dubrovnik). The core area of the base quickly took shape, largely thanks to [cpybara](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/cpybara), [smcz19](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/smcz19), LordGalvatronMC, Joey_Coconut, and [YoMoBoYo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YoMoBoYo). The base was kept as condensed within a single windswept savanna biome, with encouragement to the base members to keep builds close together and also connected where possible. The base remained uneventful and quiet for the short time-span it existed for.

### Grief
It was found by [TockTick](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TockTick) on June 16th as a result of an old chunk trail running through the base's [Pearl dock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ender_pearl_loading#Water_Column_Method). He began sending pictures of the base to a variety of players, including [Dima788](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dima788) and [maliktheking](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/maliktheking), who warned the builders that the base was compromised. They initially decided to invite TockTick, Dima, and malik to build at the base and simply continue, but it was then revealed that TockTick had sent pictures of the base to many other players. Amid concerns of the images being [Terrain exploited](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coordinate_exploit#Terrain_Exploit), The base members invited the most active Astral recruits, rushed to finish as many builds as possible, and self-griefed on June 18, 2023.

## Architecture
New Menegroth was modeled after a previous Astral Brotherhood base called [Menegroth](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Formative_bases). Thematically it was inspired by [Rivendell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivendell), but with an added twist of a [Steampunk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk) theme with an overall emphasis on water. The result was a base comprised of stone-brick-framed prismarine foundations, quartz and bone walls, and purpur roofs with sandstone detailing. The base was built entirely in a windswept savanna biome, and featured a variety of bridges, aqueducts, waterwheels, and a dam.

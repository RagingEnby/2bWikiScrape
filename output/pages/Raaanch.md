**Raaanch** is an explorer, streamer, and member of the [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons) and [GrayBeard Geezers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/GrayBeard_Geezers).

## History
Raaanch joined 2b2t in November 2018 after growing tired of other overly restrictive servers. He set up quickly near spawn, which he wandered around before going inactive until the end of 2019.

He rejoined in late 2019 and began to stream, becoming one of the most watched 2b2t streamers throughout 2020 and 2021. He was invited to build at [Negative Entropy's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Negative_Entropy) [Spawn Train](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Train), which in turn led to an invitation to the [2b2t Party Committee](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Party_Committee). Through the connections made there, he became a member of the [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons).

Raaanch has a large item collection and is recorded in the 2b2t Signed Book and Collectibles Discord as the collector with the most original books. He also participates in set building for the [2b2t Chronicles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Chronicles).

In 2023, Raaanch was approached by [MuskWizard](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MuskWizard) to join the [GrayBeard Geezers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/GrayBeard_Geezers) as a member of the GrayBeard OG Board, which are the leaders of the GrayBeard Geezers. He accepted, and joined the group in building at all their various bases. Raaanch has built at or visited every one of the GrayBeard's bases so far, attending events, signing books, and overall being a friend to many of their members. Raaanch has also streamed every one of the GeezerTown Bases on his Twitch.

**Sago** is a prominent 2b2t player renowned for his "Clowning" videos on his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Sago2b2t/) and his expertise in [Crystal PvP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crystal_PvP) within the 2b2t community.

## History
### Upbringing
**Sago** first joined the server in October 2018. Demonstrating a keen understanding of the server’s meta, he swiftly established himself as a significant player through his Twitch streams during the early stages of his 2b2t journey. Sago regularly streamed activities such as base hunting and spawn camping from Summer 2019 until December of the same year, cultivating a dedicated fanbase by promoting his Twitch link within the in-game chat.

### Affiliations
Around the time he began streaming, Sago joined the clan [Dungannon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dungannon), reconnecting with players he had previously based with. Within Dungannon, Sago formed close friendships and met influential individuals who were instrumental in advancing his 2b2t career. Notably, he encountered a key member involved in the [Invisible Pig Godmode Glitch](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pig_Godmode) and affiliated with [Team Godmode](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Godmode). This individual shared the methodology of the glitch with Sago and a select group within Dungannon, enabling Sago to demonstrate the glitch during his Twitch streams. This garnered significant attention from the community due to the glitch’s disruptive nature, but also resulted in Sago attracting numerous adversaries and becoming a frequent target at spawn.

Sago was actively involved in [The Purge](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Purge), specifically the IX Incursion, a conflict against [Etika](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/EtikaWNetwork) and his fanbase. At the time, Sago was at odds with the clan [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium), which played a major role in organizing the purge. Despite this, Sago collaborated with Emperium to support the purge efforts. Assigned to the Lag Machine sector, Sago constructed various [Lag Machines](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lag_machine) to obstruct Etika and his followers from accessing the server. After enduring 2-3 lag machines, Sago’s account was [Prio Banned](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Prio_Banned), hindering his ability to participate effectively. Subsequently, he contributed to the spawn team’s efforts to prevent new players from entering the Nether.

Later, Sago partnered with players [Ace](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ace) and [JayAmazingness](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/JayAmazingness) to overhaul the clan Dungannon, transitioning its members into a more structured clan led by Sago and [JayAmazingness](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/JayAmazingness). This new group, named [Exodus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Exodus), initially functioned as a 2b2t clan engaged in typical activities such as basing and PvP. However, Exodus soon migrated to the OldFag server, evolving into a primarily social group. Sago joined the Emperium clan after forging friendships with several members during The Purge, seeking a more active role in 2b2t gameplay. Exodus eventually disbanded following the exposure of [JayAmazingness](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/JayAmazingness) for pedophilia involving another 2b2t player. In response, Sago swiftly requested ownership of the Exodus Discord prior to the scandal becoming widely known, subsequently archiving it to prevent further use and banning JayAmazingness, thereby concluding Exodus.

After the dissolution of Exodus, Sago redirected his efforts towards participating with Emperium, quickly adopting a PvP-centric role in alignment with Emperium’s focus. He played a pivotal role in significant griefing events, including the major VoCo grief that terminated the alliance between VoCo and Emperium, impacting over 25 bases and stashes. Within Emperium, Sago primarily engaged in PvP activities while occasionally assisting with base-related tasks.

### Downfall
As a member of Emperium, Sago was part of an organization infamous for dominating spawn, griefing bases and stashes, and engaging in antagonistic behavior. Emperium’s PvP-oriented members frequently sought competitive advantages through the use of custom hacked clients such as [Xulu](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Xulu), [Wurst+](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Wurst%2B), and others. This relentless pursuit of an upper hand ultimately led to vulnerabilities, resulting in the group succumbing to the [Phobos Backdoor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Phobos_Backdoor). Faced with these developments, Sago chose to disengage from the server.

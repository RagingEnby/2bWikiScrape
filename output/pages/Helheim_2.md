## History
### Helheim 2
Helheim 2 was founded by [HURTLOCKERBECK](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HURTLOCKERBECK), [mootvey](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/mootvey), and [cpybara](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/cpybara) on April 17, 2022 following the abandonment of [Helheim](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Helheim_Franchise). They invited the majority of the other [Meteorites](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Ranks) to the location and began building quickly. Progress was accelerated by many new Astral recruits at the base, in addition to a small stash donated by [MAC_TONIGHT_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MAC_TONIGHT_).

A building competition was held at the base on May 5th, 2022, which was won by [xrayessay](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xrayessay), with [Ranlen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ranlen) and [YoMoBoYo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YoMoBoYo) coming in second and third places, respectively. Afterward, cpybara started a project to build a large tree and drastically expand the base, but the base's stash was stolen on May 16th, 2022.

The members decided to abandon the base after, with many the members going to [Lidenbrock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lidenbrock), while the rest went to [Neritum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Helheim_Franchise). The base sat for a month before being griefed by [Bezopasan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bezopasan), [maksitaxi](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/maksitaxi), and [Odpay](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Odpay) on June 25, 2022.

### Hintertown 6
When Helheim 2 was first founded, a number of the members were unsatisfied with the terrain, and founded a new base nearby on the same day. They called the base Hintertown 6, which was the 6th installment of [Hinterhof's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hinterhof) Hintertown base series. It was mainly constructed by Hinterhof, [I_tri](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/I_tri), and cpybara. The base was abandoned on May 4th, 2022 after Hinterhof decided to leave and start a new base. Hintertown 6 was self-griefed by [Enchoseon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Enchoseon) on June 25, 2022.

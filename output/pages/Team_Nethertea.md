}}Team Nethertea was a group of players dedicated to tracking down and killing [FitMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit). The group was founded on April 17th, 2018, by FloatTea. Leadership was passed on to WitBlue on January 23rd, 2019.

#### History
#### Phase 1:
[FloatTea](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FloatTea) joined 2b2t shortly after [AntVenom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AntVenom)'s video on the server, so she could be considered an [ant](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Social_Classes). She then made her famous video where she declared war to [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) and started Team Nethertea. It took her a few months, but she managed to track [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) down on stream and come face to face with him in the middle of the [7th Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Incursions). OPWolfy and [digandbuilder](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/digandbuilder) were getting ready to help FloatTea kill [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit), as he had let them join him in his spawn patrol stream thinking they were there to help. However, digandbuilder sent coords to [Armorsmith](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith) for no reason at all, causing him to show up and making [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) leave and stop the stream out of fear of getting killed live by him again ([Armorsmith](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith) had made [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) log during the [6th Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Incursions)). FloatTea left the server and her YouTube channel shortly after to focus on real life.

#### Phase 2:
After obtaining the FloatTea account on December 11th, 2018, WitBlue told FloatTea he would take on the task of killing [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) himself, to which she approved. This lead to Team Nethertea being brought back by WitBlue on January 23rd, 2019. The group managed to kill Fit during a livestream on February 24th, 2020. The group would go inactive shortly after and disband, reforming into a meme group known as Team Furry in the summer of 2020.

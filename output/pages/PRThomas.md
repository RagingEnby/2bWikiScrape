**PRThomas** is a well known seller/duper in more recent 2b2t history, he is very widely known for his mass banner production/placement around spawn, beginning in early 2019.

## History
PRThomas joined 2b2t in December 2017 as a normal newfag on 2b2t. PRThomas spent most of his early times exploring, trading and building. When he started out, a group of four new players including him met on the x+ highway. They founded the now 'dead' group ALNG, which stands for 'ALL LOOT NO GRIEF', of which PRThomas is the only person who still plays on the server from that group (that he is aware of). His first 3 proper bases were with members of the group. The group peaked at ~30 members, but fell apart quickly due to the inexperience of the members, with most members leaving and an insider leaking a base. After the decline of ALNG and grief of its last major base, PRThomas went far from spawn where he built 2 bases, Golden Hills and a smaller unnamed base. During the lifespan of Golden hills, his main account did not leave the base once, alt accounts were used for all other activities. Around October 2018, PRThomas left the server, but came back in January 2019 to participate in the 2911 dupe base and StashX, where the wealth needed to start The Bannering was gained.

The discord server for The Bannering was created in February 2019, marking the start of the mass placement of banners. After growing in size, an item shop was added to the server, and in July, the server was reworked to be more like a group. The server grew to 800â€”1000 members, and slowly declined until May 2020, when a long term member turned on the group and self-botted his discord account, banning all non-admin members. Although there is currently no discord server and the group was informally disbanded, some members continue to place banners, including PRThomas.

## Bases
This is a mostly complete record of all significant bases PRThomas built or was involved in, however some entries are intentionally unrecorded for various reasons.

Format: Base Name (otherwise unknown), Condition, creation time, members, additional information.

-Unnamed, Raided and minorly greifed, made in early-mid 2018. Members: PRThomas, therussianwolf133, zulanu, other unknown/forgotten players.

-doenerboy's base, exploded, made unknown date. Members: PRThomas, doenerboy, doenerboy's friend (identity unknown). The base was blown up by its members after a group of french players found it during the Fuze (Baguette) Invasion.

-2911, blown up, January 2019. Members: Mike_embed, PRThomas, yuicide, allgoodnamesaregone, zero1up, 2b2t_ and many more unknown members. Blown up when found, griefed and then restored by mike multiple times until his disappearance from 2b2t. This was a dupe station made Mike_embed had setup close to spawn when the chunk dupe still worked. Many kits here were duped and given out for free to new players. After the dupe had been patched, it wasn't used as much, but for a solid amount of weeks Mike_embed and yuicide spent a lot of time duping and dispensing. (thanks mike)

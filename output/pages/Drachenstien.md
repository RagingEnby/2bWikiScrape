**Drachenstien** is a builder that joined in January of 2017.
## History
### Early Months
Drachenstien joined the server in January 2017, after hearing about it through a friend on a factions server. He made a base around 100k out with a few other players, it was quickly griefed by [WomenAreObjects](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/WomenAreObjects). All of Drachenstien's basemates promptly quit. Not knowing how to use hacks, he walked to 1 million blocks out, using the nether highway. It was here that Drachenstien made another base, called Orelia, and met [Flick3r](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Flick3r), who invited him to the [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium). After seeing how all the factions interacted with each other, Drachenstien decided to make a base not associated with any of them. Trading [househousehouse1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/househousehouse1) for tnt, Drachenstien used it to clear out a large cavern for his new base with [Niftyrobo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Niftyrobo). While there, Drachenstien met [Antius777](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Antius777), who left his base to him while he left for a several year hiatus from the server to learn martial arts in China. [doctrzombie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/doctrzombie) found Antius777's base and performed a base tour.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGMcqggxLBg&list=PLNhPEz4tQxua3dZhi8w76wYCP6q8jOI77&index=4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGMcqggxLBg&list=PLNhPEz4tQxua3dZhi8w76wYCP6q8jOI77&index=4)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kyBSBkH6Nw&list=PLNhPEz4tQxua3dZhi8w76wYCP6q8jOI77&index=5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kyBSBkH6Nw&list=PLNhPEz4tQxua3dZhi8w76wYCP6q8jOI77&index=5) Antius777 wished Drachenstien well, and has not been seen since early 2017.

### Return to Spawn
Following the departure of Antius777, Drachenstien again met up with Flick3r, who supplied him with the beginnings of a small fortune, including such things as gold apples, spawners, and enchanted diamond armor. Over the next couple months, Drachenstien traded himself into a king's ransom of wealth, he became a respected, well-connected spawn area resident.

### Meeting jared2013
Drachenstien was invited to a spawnbase, called [The Pennydropper](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Pennydropper), where he met jared2013, who signed a book for him, saying "Drachenstien is better then [Tenderhart](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tenderhart)" and "Tenderhart is a fag." Flying around spawn a little later, Drachenstien ran into [D4RKJ0E](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D4RKJ0E), who said his famous catchphrase, "ur mum is a ram". Thinking D4RKJ0E was a new player, and not, in fact, jared2013, Drachenstien attempted to troll D4RKJ0E, boxxing him in cobblestone for a time. Upon realizing D4RKJ0E's identity, Drachenstien brought him to the Pennydropper. jared2013 revealed that it was his old spawn base. He was not pleased that it had a become a so-called "newfag flea market."

### JaredTown
In July of 2017, jared2013 invited Drachenstien, [KhanTusion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KhanTusion), [pYr01v1aniac](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/pYrO1v1aniac) to help repair his old spawnbase at 666,666 which he called "JaredTown".[https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/6l4zp9/jaredtown_revival_july_3_2017/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/6l4zp9/jaredtown_revival_july_3_2017/) The group quickly attracted many other players until there was about 20 in the immediate vicinity of the place. The [Peacekeepers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Peacekeepers) began to attack, but the group at JaredTown put up a cohesive defense, even though much of the town was lavacasted over about two days. This changed when a lone player within the defense of JaredTown suicide bombed and killed several players. The whole area descended into chaos. The whole base was destroyed while jared2013 and Drachenstien looked on.

### We can dance if we want to
In October of 2017, as a result of the announcement that veteran queue would be removed, Drachenstien offered to the 2b2t community that he would pay queue for 2 months for some [oldfaggots](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/oldfaggots).[https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/77c9fb/we_can_dance_if_we_want_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/77c9fb/we_can_dance_if_we_want_to/)[https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/77o43p/take_on_me/](https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/77o43p/take_on_me/) In all, he gifted 2 months of free queue to 11 people, the names being:

* [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa)
* [drewbookman](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/drewbookman)
* [__dae](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/__dae)
* [doctrzombie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/doctrzombie)
* [Negative_Entropy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Negative_Entropy)
* [CytotoxicTcell](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CytotoxicTcell)
* [willyroof](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/willyroof)
* [0xymoron](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0xymoron)
* [aw3some_0ne](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/aw3some_0ne)
* [Sun Wukon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sun_Wukon)
Drachenstien was doxxed for his generosity, but followed through with the 2 months anyway, even offering to expand the group to include:
* [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013)
* [Offtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Offtopia)
* [James_Rustles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/James_Rustles)
* [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2)
His actions were overall well received by most of the community.
### Rhodes
After the fall of JaredTown, jared2013 invited Drachenstien to [Rhodes](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rhodes), which had been handed to jared for safekeeping when its residents, friends of jared2013's, had left the server. It was, however, not to last. [Parthicus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Parthicus) found the base one night when no one was on, and stole all of the gear stored there from the [Stacked Item Dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Stacked_Item_Dupe). Demoralized, the members destroyed the base. Drachenstien took a several month long hiatus. Upon returning, Drachenstien took part in a variety of small projects, most notably, Endirt Island in the End, with [_m_o_t_h_r_a_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_m_o_t_h_r_a_).

### Friendship with Sniper231996
In the Fall of 2017, Drachenstien returned to spawn, where he met [Sniper231996](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sniper231996). Sniper231996 quickly invited him to [Sniper's Peaceful Island](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sniper%27s_Peaceful_Island) where they became good friends. Drachenstien was later invited to [Valinor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valinor).  In October of 2018, Drachenstien was elected vice-president of [Armorsmith's Followers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith%27s_Followers), before being removed from office.
Drachenstein 2b2t increasingly intermittently, although he later based at [Rat House](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rat_House) in 2021.

}}**The Astral Brotherhood** is a private building group that is comprised of mainly older players.

## History
The group was founded by [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) and [LordGalvatronMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/LordGalvatronMC) on August 22nd, 2021. After the fall of all the major groups of the previous years such as [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium), [Vortex Coalition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vortex_Coalition), and [Infinity Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinity_Incursion), the two friends expressed mutual interest in reviving the [Astral Order](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Order), seeing it as a good opportunity to capitalize on the vacuum of builders seeking a new group. They invited builders from the aforementioned groups, as well as [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate), [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen), [Builders Haven: Remastered](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Builders_Haven#Second_Take) and [Drain Gang](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Drain_Gang).

### Formative bases
[I_tri](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/I_tri) founded the first base, Vega, with Joey_Coconut on August 22nd 2021. The base housed 34 members until being griefed by [The Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys) on Sept. 6th 2021. After this, the group introduced the Shrine Program and a more concrete vouch system to further scrutinize applicants.

Up to the end of Vega, every member of the group was at the same base. Upon its grief, this changed. Santiago - the second meteorite base - was founded on September 7 2021 by [Beardler](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Beardler), and Menegroth - the first Lunarium base - was founded by Joey_Coconut and Galvatron a few days later. Santiago was inactive for the majority of its lifespan, [Enchoseon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Enchoseon) built a significant portion of the base by herself. After its grief, the Shooting Star rank was instituted to de-rank inactive members without fully removing them from the group.

At Menegroth, many players built, especially [A97J](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/A97J), Joey_Coconut, LordGalvatronMC, [smcz19](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/smcz19), and [bread_loafs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/bread_loafs). Activity slowed as burnout set in. Upon Santiago's grief in early October 2021, a new full-group project was started - Astralia. The base started as a quick resource-gathering operation for a few bored Menegroth builders, but quickly became a well-attended group base, inhabited by Enchoseon, [crzychris](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/crzychris), A97J, [SCR3BALL7030](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SCR3BALL7030) and Joey_Coconut. Intended to host a Halloween event for the group, it was self-griefed along with [Gaza](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate#Gaza) and [Halicarnassus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Halicarnassus) after the [Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column) griefed Menegroth.

Following the grief of the [Rat House](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rat_House), many of its builders joined the Astral Brotherhood, although many were already members. The Capybara Castle was founded for the fomer Rat House builders, although few (the exception being [Aresyl](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Aresyl)) built at the location between its foundation in October 2021 and its grief in February 2022.

### Okab
[CirocDrip](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CirocDrip) founded Okab a few days after the destruction of Astralia. It was initially purely for Meteorite members, meaning the base was not particularly active for much of its lifespan. After the base was accidentally leaked through a failed [Baritone](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Baritone) command, Enchoseon and Joey_Coconut relocated the signboard several thousand blocks away, and invited many higher ranked members of the group. After a building competition and a large group project (the Beard hole), the base exploded in size. It was leaked after [Redstoner](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Redstoner) logged onto a group member's account using the [Log4j exploit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Log4j_exploit), and was subsequently griefed by [BIKMUNNI](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BIKMUNNI).

### Nautilus Era
{{See also|Nautilus|Poppy Town}}
Nautilus was founded in October 2021 by Joey_Coconut after the grief of Menegroth. The members, led largely by Enchoseon, build a large elliptical drain there over the course over the next few months. Once the draining process concluded, the members dug out the entire area in under a week. The base progressed in waves, with the most significant being right before it was self-griefed in January 2022 after it was determined that [7red](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/7red) had leaked the coordinates.

Astral came to the Poppy Town on January 2nd, 2022 after the grief of Okab, the base continued in parallel with Nautilus, before all members moved there after Nautilus's grief. Poppy Town itself was griefed by both the Fifth Column and the builders of the base on February 2nd, 2022.

### April 2022 Expansion
Following the grief of Poppy Town, the group's focus pivoted, with the ranked bases of Durkaa's Farm and Kekwtown slowing almost to a standstill, while [Obsidian Isle](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Obsidian_Isle) was founded to build with many members and affiliates of Astral somewhat regardless of their ranks within the group. Many groups and players were invited to Obsidian Isle, mostly from the [Ancients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ancients), [Spawnmasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons), and [Highway Workers Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Workers_Union). This brought a large influx of builders into the group. This, coupled with the recruitment of a large group of people (including [r22r](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/r22r), [cpybara](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/cpybara), [xrayessay](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xrayessay), [YoMoBoYo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YoMoBoYo), [mootvey](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/mootvey), and [white_wolfy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/white_wolfy)), resulted in activity within the group rising to an all-time high, as well as the foundation of a short-lived feeder group called the 'Terrestrial Sisterhood'. Bases founded in this era include 3 Moonshriner bases (Hurtbase, Dorado, and D_loaded's base), 4 Meteorite bases (Helheim, [Helheim 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Helheim_2), and Hintertown 6, Neritum), and a Lunarium base ([New Lugdunum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/New_Lugdunum)). The End Gape was also constructed along with Polish YouTuber [elomordo](https://www.youtube.com/c/elomordo).

#### Helheim Franchise
{{See also|Helheim 2}}
The main group activity in this period came through the Helheim series of bases, starting with the short-lived Helhieim, which was founded by cpybara. All the new members of the group from the recent Moonshriner bases and from Obsidian Isle were added to Helheim, making it the most active Astral Base at the time. After a map was made of the base a week later and [rebane2001](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/rebane2001) visited, it was determined to abandon the base. Immediately afterward, HURTLOCKERBECK, cpybara, and mootvey co-founded [Helheim 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Helheim_2), which fared better, and had a variety of builds constructed at it. Helheim 2 was also the site of a building competition (won by xrayessay). Some members at Helheim 2 decided to build in a different terrain type, and so, led by [hinterhof](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/hinterhof), they started building Hintertown 6 several thousand blocks away. Both Helheim 2 and Hintertown 6 were abandoned after Helheim 2 was robbed of all its building materials. Some members were promoted to Lunarium and moved to New Lugdunum, while others continued on to r22r's new Astral base, Neritum, which soon thereafter went inactive excepting r22r.

#### New Lugdunum
{{Main|New Lugdunum}}
New Lugdunum (often shortened to 'New Lug', or simply 'Lug'), was founded by LordgalvatronMC and Joey_Coconut on 20 March, 2022 as a spiritual successor to the Astral Order base, [Lugdunum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Order#Mon-dunum_Days). It was constructed on 2 extreme hills biome islands as a medieval town with infrastructure in-progress to connect the two islands. The base progressed regularly, especially as a result of smcz19's efforts. It was griefed by BSB on May 18, 2022.

### Lidenbrock
{{Main|Lidenbrock}}
Following the grief of New Lugdunum, there were no immediate plans as to the next base. Joey_Coconut designed a large dome for a project he entitled 'Lidenbrock', and founded a base to construct it at on May 25, 2022. After design of the dome was complete, xrayessay, YoMoBoYo, and cpybara designed a terraform to put in the dome, and Enchoseon designed a large tree to place at the center. The hole was dug on the server in under 2 weeks, largely as a result of Durkaa's efforts and Beardler's return to Astral. After the hole was dug, progress slowed, with Beardler building a majority of the base over its month's existence. It was griefed by Zetrax and [maksitaxi](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/maksitaxi) on June 25, 2022 amidst the grief of a number of other Astral bases, although Lidrenbrock was not meant to be griefed that day. As a result, almost no TNT was brought, and the base members willingly donated TNT to the griefers. Lidenbrock was griefed along with Helheim 2, Skylight's Haven, and Terrestrial Sisterhood 1, in addition to self-griefs on Helheim, Neritum, The Drip, and Hintertown 6.

### Post-Lidenbrock Interlude
A shortlived main base called Palmyra was started after the grief of Lidenbrock, although it was abandoned before any builds were started when it was leaked to the Astral leadership that it had been [Steampunkjax](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Steampunkjax) who had leaked New Lugdunum and Lidenbrock, as well as various [SBA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SBA) and [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) bases, as well as [MoLaST](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MoLaST), after Steampunkjax offered to sell the IPs of several astral members (Steampunk maintained afterward that he did not have any IPs and that it had been a red herring on his part). Steampunkjax was removed from the group, and [Dubrovnik](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dubrovnik) was founded. Founded within days of Palmyra was Solaris.

### -aris bases
{{See also|Solaris|Stellaris}}
Following the grief of Neritum, HURTLOCKERBECK founded [Solaris](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Solaris) as the next major meteorite base of the group on July 29, 2022. Initial progress was slow, although as a result of many new meteorites being invited from SBA and [T gang](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/T_gang), it increased significantly in size, especially as a result of [AnimeTiddie's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AnimeTiddie) castle. The base was griefed by BSB on October 14, 2022. The base's name started a trend in the names of astral meteorite bases over the next 6 months, with nearly all subsequent bases (Polaris, Stellaris, Molaris) having similar names, and being occupied by a similar group. Polaris was a short-lived base in December, but was followed by [Stellaris](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Stellaris) and Taiyo.

Taiyo was founded on December 20, 2022 and lasted only to January 2, 2023 after it was leaked by [Makaneek](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Makaneek) to the Fifth Column. Despite the base's limited lifespan, [RICELAND1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/RICELAND1) and Animetiddie were still able to complete many of their planned builds. The members of Taiyo moved to Stellaris.

Stellaris was founded on September 17, 2022 by [Berkoes](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Berkoes) and [Katzeflocken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Katzeflocken) as a sequel to [Stone Brick Sanctuary](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Stone_Brick_Sanctuary), and was thus originally named 'Stone Brick Sanctuary 2'. After the base went inactive, Katze and Berkoes merged the SBS group into astral, resulting in the invitation of many players to the base. Universin, [Osmobyte](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Osmobyte), RICELAND1, and AnimeTiddie constructed most of the builds at the base, resulting in it becoming the largest meteorite base of the group ever constructed. Following its grief, the members split between Molaris, Aeolus, and Dubrovnik.

### Dubrovnik
{{Main|Dubrovnik}}
Following the grief of Lidenbrock and the abandonment of Palmyra, Dubrovnik was founded on August 23, 2022 by Joey_Coconut, LordGalvatronMC, smcz19, and cpybara as a short-term, less-planned, and smaller scale base than the two previous, which had been large time-consuming group projects. On the 1-month anniversary of the base, a celebration was held that saw smcz19 promoted to the council, the leadership in the group. Dubrovnik expanded for months, and it was decided to stay there more permanently and significantly expand beyond the base's original scope. Large builds were constructed there such as xrayessay's cathedral and Joey_Coconut & YoMoBoYo's meteor. Also started was RICELAND1's 'Son of Veles'. The base was found in late March 2023 by an unknown base hunter who stole all the base's building materials during a lull in activity. The council decided to invite all active affiliates of the group to Dubrovnik, who built there (amidst several other uninvited players arriving at the base) until [Snippykeegan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Snippykeegan) attempted to sell the base to Dima788 on April 9th. Dima warned Galvatron and Joey; they self-griefed the base, as well as Elsweyr and Aeolus along with several other members of the group.

### New Menegroth
{{Main|New Menegroth}}After the grief of Dubrovnik, [New Menegroth](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/New_Menegroth) would be founded on April 29, 2023 by [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut), [LordGalvatronMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/LordGalvatronMC), and [smcz19](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/smcz19). The base would experience steady growth, until it was found by a base hunter named TockTick on June 16th 2023. It was quickly discovered by the group's leadership that TockTick had compromised the base through sharing images of it to a number of players. As such, on June 18th, a handful of meteorites would be invited to make last minute additions before the scheduled self grief which occurred on the same day.

}}**Team Imperia** was a small  neutral group in 2016 that was started by [TheDeathDoctrine](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheDeathDoctrine) and [Niftyrobo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Niftyrobo).

## History
Team Imperia began in October 2016 as a result of two groups merging: [TheDeathDoctrine's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheDeathDoctrine) group, The [Anarchists](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Anarchists), and [Niftyrobo's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Niftyrobo) group, The [Inalegie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Inalegie).

Not much is currently known about the Anarchists, but the other half, the Inalegie, originally started in September 2016 when a newfag named Niftyrobo started a team called "The Epists". The Epists started a base in [spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn#Outer_Spawn), but was later abandoned to form a base called PRAWN base. Niftyrobo met TheDeathDoctrine when he bought a map from him, starting the friendship. The Epists went on to rename themselves "The Inalegie", and let in more members like Crystallising, DemonCrown, and Nourdica. PRAWN base was griefed by [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids) in late October when PeterRichards gave him the coords after finding the base by chance.

A coup occurred within the group in December 2016,  which began because of disputes over a toxic member. This resulted in numerous members leaving and creating [Team Malaria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Malaria). The coup was spearheaded by [Crystallising](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crystallising) and [Flyinqq](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Flyinqq). Due to this coup and heavy loss in members, TheDeathDoctrine and Niftyrobo officially met to discuss the future of the group and chose to discontinue it. Imperia would later disband on December 12th, 2016, with a failed attempt at revival two weeks later.

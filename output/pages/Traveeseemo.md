## History
### Early History
Traveeseemo first joined 2b2t in Spring/Summer 2013, after playing on other anarchy servers. 2b2t appealed to Traveeseemo as an extremely difficult server to play vanilla minecraft. After escaping spawn, Traveeseemo boated through the oceans and settled in near-ish [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn). Traveeseemo played the server on and off for a few years until the removal of [Veteran Queue](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Veteran_Queue) in December 2017. Traveeseemo eventually came back to server in March 2023.

### Membership in Donfuer
Traveesemo logged back in on a boat in an old ocean and started migrating to settle down in a further location. While traveling overworld he saw a member of [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) posting fake coordinates of the Donfuer main base and other members of DonFuer jokingly reacting to the fake coordinates. Believing the coordinates to be real, Traveeseemo looked into the group and soon joined. Traveeseemo co-founded [Don Maximus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Don_Maximus) with [Max1mumChr1s](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Max1mumChr1s) and helped to run the base until he was given a higher rank and invited to [Steamfuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer). Traveeseemo later co-founded [DonFuer 27](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_27) with [Phosph0lipid](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Phosph0lipid), while also starting and contributing to various other bases including [Don Chyku](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Don_Chyku), [Donfuer 28](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer_28), and various DonFuer Scout bases.

### Membership in Greybeard Geezers, VEA, and United Builders Republic
Throughout late 2023, Traveeseemo joined the Greybeard Geezers and [Vapepens Elite Alliance](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vapepens_Elite_Alliance), building at Geezertown 6 & 7 with the Geezers, and [Chromatown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vapepens_Elite_Alliance) & [The Shelf](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vapepens_Elite_Alliance) with VEA.

In late 2024, Traveeseemo started [United Builders Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/United_Builders_Republic) alongside several other friends with the intention of fostering inter-group collaboration and lessening drama. He helped to run the group at its start while also founding several smaller bases, before handing operational responsibility for the group over to [hotpandalovin504](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/hotpandalovin504) & [rainbowren11](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/rainbowren11), and ultimately going inactive.

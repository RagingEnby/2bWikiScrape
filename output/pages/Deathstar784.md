**Deathstar784** is a builder who joined in 2020.

## Early History
Deathstar784 joined 2b2t in October 2020 because of his friend [Iamzeiss](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IAmZeiss). For a long time, his goal to not die in-game. The first base that Deathstar built at was [Cum Zone II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cum_Zone_II).

## DonFuer
Deathstar joined [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) along with [IAmZeiss](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IAmZeiss) and would rank up quickly. After building at various low-ranking bases he was invited to [DonFuer 20](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_20) but wouldn't contribute much there. He would come to [Donfuer 22](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_22) and build the Japanese area of the base. Following [DonFuer 22](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_22), Deathstar went inactive for about a year during [Donfuer 23](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer_23). After his hiatus he would come to [DonFuer 25](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_25) and contribute greatly to the base, adding things like the Baseball Stadium, DonCorp, Up House, Chillis, and other smaller builds. In December 2022 he was promoted to Noble in [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer).

Deathstar was one of the most active members at [Donfuer 28](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer_28), helping to manage the base alongside [Lukent](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lukent) and [N8TT](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/N8TT). After it was self-griefed, he was promoted to "Elder" in Donfuer.

Deathstar continues to be a semi-active member of Donfuer.

# TheDark_Emperor

{{Outdated}}

**TheDark_Emperor** is the founder and leader of [The Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium).

## History
### Early Days on 2b2t
TheDark_Emperor joined 2b2t in late 2016 after seeing [TheCampingRusher's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) videos of the server. Emperor had planned the basic structure of [The Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium) before even purchasing his minecraft account, which allowed him to immediately begin recruiting for the then-nascent group. Emperor created his first base, soon thereafter, which he named Arrowhead. Emperor stayed for several months, and left after the Donkey Dupe. The base was later griefed by [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) in 2019.<sup>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA9Rj1T79cY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bA9Rj1T79cY)</sup> Following the Donkey Dupe, Emperor led the Emperium to a peaceful settlement of the [Voperium Conflict](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Vo-Perium_Conflict).

### UGE
In mid-2018, Emperor assimilated large elements of [Team Coca Cola](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Coca_Cola), [The Asylum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Asylum), and [Singularity](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Singularity) into the Emperium, nominally under the banner of the [UGE](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/UGE). The UGE was an extremely large power bloc, which caused the foundation of the [Alpha Alliance](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Alpha_Alliance) as an attempted counterbalance against them. The [Alpha Alliance](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Alpha_Alliance) including [Highland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highland), [Infrared](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infrared), and others. The Emperium and UGE were able to defeat this alliance with relative ease. With all the new members from the various UGE factions, the Emperium doubled its size.

### 2020
Since 2020 started, Emperor has gone on to do even more things and continues to play on the server regularly. In May 2020 he got doxxed by player named Forceken, who made a mapart was made of his face which got distributed all over spawn. Later the same month he created the [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen), along with [HermeticLock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HermeticLock) and [Orsond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Orsond).

### 2022
Emperor returned to 2b2t in February 2022 after a year long hiatus, he decided to revive The [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium) and invited many new 2b2t players and old members that used to be in the group.

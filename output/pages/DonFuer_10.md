**DonFuer 10** was a base built mainly by [D_loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_loaded), [HermeticLock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HermeticLock), and [Surviverkiller](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Surviverkiller) (but also many others) throughout December of 2016 and January of 2017, as part of the group [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer). It was leaked by [Coltsnid](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coltsnid) on January 14, 2017, and then subsequently [griefed](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/griefed) by [Babbaj](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Babbaj); only a few hours after the grief, [BarrenDome](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BarrenDome) uploaded a tour of the base on YouTube which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ip2U8W0ZJU&list=PLx76wlTr_Jd7Ko6MBZQXt32062HLIrJXW&index=34&app=desktop).

## History
From the time of its founding, the 10th DonFuer was mainly constructed by the original crew, D_loaded, HermeticLock, and Surviverkiller. Towards January, many others came to work on the base, as many as 15 at some points (some of which did not build anything at the site). It was D_loaded and HermeticLock's plan to get prominent [Vortex Coalition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vortex_Coalition) members at the base and use it to launch their 2b2t careers, but the plan turned sour as internal issues led to Coltsnid leaking the coordinates after a short while. Other players, such as [Offtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Offtopia), were going to arrive at the base, but it was griefed before it could happen.

Base members included D_loaded, HermeticLock, Surviverkiller, [mcbain_epic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/mcbain_epic), [Whygoodboyg](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Whygoodboyg), [BlackRoseBunny](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BlackRoseBunny), [Salamander27](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Salamander27), and others. A now-unlisted tour by HermetickLock shows the base and the destruction there after it was leaked.

#### Rebuild
In October 2020, DonFuer 10 was  rebuilt and remodeled, with multiple new buildings and additions to existing structures and roads. Unfortunately, the rebuild became one of the first victims of the Phobos backdoor. After initially being fought off, 3vt and others were able greif the rebuild.

#### 2nd Rebuild
DonFuer attempted again a few weeks later this time finising the rebuild completely in early January 2021. With members [saznag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/saznag) and [skyiswierd](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/skyiswierd) doing most of the work. It was subsequently toured by Hermeticlock, as well as several minor youtubers.

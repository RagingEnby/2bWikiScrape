#REDIRECT [End portal](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/End_portal)re that is used as the only gateway into the End Dimension. On 2b2t, however, end portals are not naturally generated, as all the supposed locations of strongholds (which host end portals) were already generated before these structures were added to the game. This fact required admin interference, in order to allow the community access to The End.

## History
In the early days, Hausemaster was less interested in building end portals, and because of that, the community couldn't access the End for quite some time, until backdoored end portal frames were used to build the first end portal functioning at [NFE](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NFE) in 2012 (an attempt to construct an end portal in 2011 had failed).

When Hausemaster found out about the existence of this end portal, and other portals which were later built around the server, he took action by deleting the End Dimension and removing the portals.

Eventually, the admin decided to add end portals back to 2b2t by regenerating chunks in the locations where strongholds were supposed to be generated. These end portals renewed access to the End, however, they were also the target of griefers. Due to the griefing of public end portals, many players relied on access to private ones which were built using backdoored items, in hidden locations.

In 2017, end portals were brought back to 2b2t in their proper locations, this time, the admin built them manually near the bedrock surface. Since then, griefers would occasionally grief all End Portals and disable access to the End for a few weeks or months until they would get rebuilt again by the admin.

In early 2021, there was a portal-breaking exploit that caused many portals to be nonfunctional oftentimes. As a result, [Durkaaqt](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Durkaaqt) started the [Guardians of the Galaxy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Durkaaqt#Guardians_of_the_Galaxy) project in [SBA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SBA) in order to keep as many portals operational as possible.
### 1.19
Following the 1.19 update, 13 additional end portals were generated around spawn, going all the way out to 27000 blocks. All the new End Portals generated beneath the old terrain, from below y level 0. The locations of the new portals were publicly released [F_i_l_i_n](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/F_i_l_i_n), with him lighting most of them, with the remainder by [TheShowerGel](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheShowerGel), [_Chiekn_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_Chiekn_), [P529](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/P529), [cpybara](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/cpybara).

### Private end portals
Private end portals were built throughout the years by players who had access to backdoored end portal frames. These end portals were useful when access to The End was limited to the community, if the public portals are griefed. These portals are kept secret for long periods of time, allowing them to survive for many years. Having access to a private end portal is considered to be a highly valuable thing on the server. Some famous private end portals include popbob's end portals, the end portal at [Kaamtown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kaamtown), the end portal at NFE, and many other portals which were built at different bases.

## Coordinates
Please note that all End Portals are located close to the bedrock level.

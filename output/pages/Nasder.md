## History
Nasder joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) on July 24, 2022. While wandering around [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn), he met [AtomicDragon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AtomicDragon), who invited him to the new player group [Heavens Gate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Heavens_Gate). He built at their [main base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Heavens_Gate_(Base)) for much of the Summer, although the group went inactive and the base was later griefed in September. Nasder returned to spawn, where he met [Amiaoghg](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Amiaoghg), who invited him to the [Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperials). Nasder built at a variety of bases with them, including [Crusaders Crash](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperials#Crusaders_Crash), [Imperial Capital](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperials#The_Capital), and several Halloween bases. He left the group on good terms in April 2023 over disagreements with the leadership, joining [Outlast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Outlast) (where many of the other Imperials members who left at that time went) as one of the leaders, and also becoming a Lunarium in [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood). While in Astral, he built at [Dubrovnik](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dubrovnik), the [Spawnquarium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnquarium), New Menegroth and Hexaverse.

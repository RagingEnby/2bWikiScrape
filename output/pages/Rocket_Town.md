**Rocket Town**, also known as **Rocket City** and **Fit's Sky base** was a base founded on March 3rd, 2017 by [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit), [bigdon50](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/bigdon50), [AlphaComputer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlphaComputer), [jddinger](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jddinger), and [ChromeCrusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ChromeCrusher).

## Leak and Destruction
The coordinates of the base were leaked by jddinger as part of a drama over [The Museum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Museum). After the base members realized that the coordinates were public they attempted to eradicate any traces of a base to make the coordinates seem like a meme. However, the main supply of TNT was accidentally blown up, leaving traces of the base everywhere.

Fit would go on to blame the destruction on [Summermelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Summermelon), in spite of the fact that jddinger was not affiliated with them at all. Fit would use this blame to justify his grief of Summermelon.

The base was added to [The Museum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Museum), then later removed after the griefing of Summermelon, and then added back later.

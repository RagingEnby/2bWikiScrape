**Michaelrule4** is a [oldfag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Social_Classes) who joined 2b2t in early 2013, and is most notable for his YouTube tutorials (now long-since deleted) on how to escape spawn and other 2b2t-related content, and his website, [2b2t.tk](https://2b2t.tk) (now a dead website). His [Facepunch](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Facepunch) username was michaelrule4.

## History
At some point in 2014, michaelrule4 began creating YouTube tutorials on how to escape the 2b2t [spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/spawn) for any new players that happened to join the server, as well as other related content. His website 2b2t.tk also had a list of coordinates to various bases and locations on 2b2t that was open to the public, although no current archive of the website exists. His videos can be found in [James_Rustles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/James_Rustles)' 2b2t media archive on GitHub.

As of 2020, all traces of him have been scrubbed from the Internet besides his GitHub profile, which still exists.

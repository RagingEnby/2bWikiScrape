}}**The Knights of Spawn** is a small group of players founded by Pharaoh64 (formerly CadetDurina) on 6/1/2017 dedicated to helping players at spawn survive and preserving builds on the server. It was annexed by the [The Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium) on about 6/16/2017, joining many of the other groups working in part for The Emperium. While under the control of The Emperium it worked to recruit new players to the group. Around October 2017, it started losing its momentum as a group and the remaining members would join The [Church of Eden](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Church_of_Eden) following the merge between [Eden's Disciples](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Eden%27s_Disciples), [Ardent Shield](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ardent_Shield), and Knights of Spawn.

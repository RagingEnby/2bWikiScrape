**Cpybara** (aka **capy**) is a builder who joined in 2022. He is known for building with several groups such as [The Ancients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Ancients), [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood), [Spawnmasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons) and [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association).

## History
### Early History
Cpybara joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) on March of 2022, initially with the ign "TylerBlevins". Immediately after joining, he wanted to create a large base, and traveled far from spawn, before returning after difficulty in accumulating materials. He bought another Minecraft account, with the name "cpybara", which would become his main account, which he mainly used in spawn. He was invited to and briefly participated in [Eclipse](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Eclipse), before being invited to build with [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) by [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut).

### Astral Brotherhood & The Ancients
Cpybara joined Astral Brotherhood, and was added to the recruit base called [Hurtbase](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#April_2022_Expansion), where he became acquainted with other builders with the group, such as [HURTLOCKERBECK](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HURTLOCKERBECK). There he also made a house which later inspired the [Spawn Migration](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Migration). Following the grief of Hurtbase, he cofounded the shortived Helheim, before moving to and cofounding the twin bases of [Helheim 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Helheim_2) and [Hintertown 6](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Helheim_2#Hintertown_6). While there he met [YoMoBoYo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YoMoBoYo) and [xrayessay](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xrayessay), who later invited him to join the [Ancients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ancients). In July of 2022, Joey_Coconut invited Cpybara to build at [Sky Masons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sky_Masons). He became a guest in the [Spawnmasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons), and constructed a wide variety of builds there, such as his flying carpet. After building at Sky Masons, he designed much of the terraformation at [Lidenbrock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lidenbrock), before constructing much of [Dubrovnik](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dubrovnik) singlehandedly. In thanks for his contributions to many of Astral Brotherhood's bases, he was given the [Solarium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Ranks) rank in the group. In late 2022 he was invited to [Block Game Babylon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Babylon), where he helped to design some of the exterior patterns on the base's central Ziggurat, Etemananke. Following the grief of Dubrovnik, he was among the first Astral members at [New Menegroth](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/New_Menegroth), where he built a large Dam.

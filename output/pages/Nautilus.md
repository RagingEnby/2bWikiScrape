}}**Nautilus** was an [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) base centered around a large elliptical drain that was constructed in late 2021 and early 2022.

## History
### Foundation and initial construction
Nautilus was founded by [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) on October 26, 2021 for the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) after the grief of [Menegroth](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Formative_bases). The name was selected from an AI generated list whose inputs were derived from the list of bases on the wiki in late 2021. The basemates quickly arrived at the location and began draining the base’s centerpiece - a 101x151 elliptical drain - one of the largest ever on the server. After some initial headway as a group, most of the members moved to [Okab](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) as they grew tired with the draining. [Enchoseon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Enchoseon) stayed at the base and led draining efforts, with help from [smcz19](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/smcz19) and [SCR3WBALL7030](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SCR3WBALL7030). Draining proved lengthy, taking place throughout November and half of December.

### Explosion of activity
Following the grief of Okab, activity spiked at Nautilus. The draining was completed, and then the area was dug to bedrock in under a week by the draining crew, in addition to [Beardler](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Beardler), smcz19, and others. [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) built his large glass mushrooms he originally designed for [Five Isles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Five_Isles) and his king jellyfish, [A97J](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/A97J) constructed the majority of a guardian farm, [I_tri](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/I_tri) built his octopus, smcz19’s storage hall was started, and Enchoseon built carrot town. Design began on the interior of the drain, and the leaders of [The Autumn Drain](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Autumn_Drain) - [Lunch_Katsu](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lunch_Katsu) and [0Channy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0Channy) were invited. Activity slowed again after the builders tired out, leaving Lunch_Katsu, SCR3WBALL7030, and Enchoseon to continue the base mostly on their own, building towers, a serpent, and preparing the area for more builds.

### Final days
After discussion with [7red](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/7red), it was revealed that he had leaked [Menegroth](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Formative_bases) to the [Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column) in October for Discord Nitro and building materials, although he was scammed out of the building materials entirely. He also leaked terrain screenshots of Nautilus not long after. They were later sent to Joey_Coconut by several players not at the base in January 2022. After discussion among the basemates, they decided that none of them wanted to continue building at a base that could easily be [terrain exploited](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coordinate_exploit). They invited [Durkaaqt](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Durkaaqt) to Nautilus. Afterward, they built for several days, in which time the central hall was finished, the mushroom forest was built, and the drain filled with builds. [Steampunkjax](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Steampunkjax), A97J, Lunch_Katsu, and smcz19 self-griefed the base on the morning of January 29th after the members tired of building.

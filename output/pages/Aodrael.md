## History
Aodrael originally heard of the server from a friend of his called [Sir_Nope](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sir_Nope). On August 22nd, 2020 he made the Aodrael account, and created the group [Unitopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Unitopia) on August 27, 2020. In 2020, Aodrael began a base with Sir_Nope on his eul8 account and joined their group, [Nova](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nova). After forming Unitopia, Aodrael befriended [A32k](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/A32k) and [CalebBlood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SolarNapalm), before inviting them to join the group. Later, he joined [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer), which was suggested to him by CalebBlood. He talked to [D_loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_loaded) about sub-groupâ€™s, and Aodrael suggested merging Unitopia with [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer), they created the [Spawn Rangers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer). Around December 12th, 2020, Aodrael was kicked out of [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) due to him causing issues with other members, resulting in the creation of [The Order](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Order).

## Republic
Aodrael would get to know [Bartolome_Mitre](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bartolome_Mitre), who was also having problems with [Donfuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer). Both he and [Bartolome_Mitre](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bartolome_Mitre) created an alliance and decided to have [The Order](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Order) create an alliance with [The Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Republic), Aodrael joined Bartolome at Carlio, and built there before it was griefed by 12master a couple months later. The two would later reunite in 2023 at a base, thus restoring their friendship.

During this alliance, Aodrael worked with Bartolome_Mitre and others to grief many of Donfuer's spawnbases and attempted to inside Donfuer as well.

Later, he was removed from the [Cakemasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cakemason%27s) in May of 2023 after a fight with a basemate, he would later leak a base because of their fight with [MadCherryBro](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MadCherryBro) on [Constantiam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Constantiam). Following this, he joined the [Sun Knights](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sunknight) on July 29, 2023, and later became a full member of the group, but later left due to their differences.

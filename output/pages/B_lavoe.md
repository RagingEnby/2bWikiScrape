**B_lavoe** is a newfag builder who joined in late-2023.

## History
### 2023
B_lavoe is a Hispanic player who joined the server first at the end of 2023. He was interested in trying out Anarachy Minecraft servers, and decided to try 2b2t for the history of the server.
When he first joined, he made the escape from spawn and gathered his early gear, after which he decided to head back to spawn to help other new players escape.

He met [Warske](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Warske) at Spawn when he was working on one of his "Spawn-Churches", where he became fast friends with him. Warske introduced B_lavoe to [Traveeseemo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Traveeseemo), and he joined [Donfuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer).

B_lavoe was invited to [Moomoo Cowtown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer) where he constructed a large medieval castle area. He also helped to construct a large amount of the roads at the base to expand the building area.

### 2024
In March of 2024, B_lavoe was one of the many Donfuer members who was invited to [Red Castle](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer). He constructed a large castle built into the side of one of the mountains in the southern side of the base.

In the middle of 2024, he was invited to [DonFuer 28](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_28), where he built a replica of Our Lady of Liche≈Ñ, although it remained incomplete due to the base being leaked and was self-griefed by Donfuer. After this he built at smaller bases such as [Don Chyku](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Don_Chyku) & [Yellow Castle](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Yellow_Castle).

When the player: [A1fastyellowgto](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/A1fastyellowgto) leaked chats and information from Donfuer's discord, B_lavoe was brought into a VC with Donfuer leaders, where B_lavoe claimed there was a misscommunication, and he was kicked from Donfuer because their leaders believed he was an insider.

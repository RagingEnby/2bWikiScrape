}}**The Emperium** is one of the most prominent groups on the server, gaining the spotlight after conflict with the [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Masons) and the [Peacekeepers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Peacekeepers) during the summer of 2017. Founded by [TheDark_Emperor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheDark_Emperor) and [rootbeerguy1212](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/rootbeerguy1212), The Emperium grew slowly, as they insisted on being exclusive. The symbol of the group is the Omega, the 24th and final letter of the Greek alphabet.

## History
Around December 2016, TheDark_Emperor, along with rootbeerguy1212, founded The Emperium. What initially started as improper spelling of Impirium would stick with the group for years to come. The miss-spelling would work in The Emperium's favor, making it more unique and edgy. The group grew fairly quickly after TheDark_Emperor formed a member base. The new base, promptly named 'Arrowhead,' became the central base of The Emperium, and established a hopeful future on the server, as their tangible progress allowed them to be regarded seperately from other groups.

Some of the more notable accomplishments The Emperium had achieved were the insiding of the Peacekeepers, which directly caused the creation of "The Order of Lucifer" (a small group with around 15 members that succeeded The Peacekeepers after Ericudo's insiding attempt).

When The Emperium was first founded, it was mostly a building group. Several bases were made by the group, some of which are still around today. As time passed, however, The Emperium's focus started to shift from just building to other things, including trading and dealing with groups such as Singularity and Team Coca-Cola. Their involvement with other groups started to gain them notoriety in the faction community.

However, when The Peacekeepers became active in spawn during the Summer of 2017, The Emperium retaliated. Several battles ensued, both sides claiming their own share of victories. During these fights, The Emperium allied with the newly succeeded group "The Order of Lucifer". The Order, for the most part, was unaware of The Emperium's involvement in their secession. The conflict began to die down as the number of active members in The Peacekeepers went down, and The Emperium, largely, returned to building multiple bases (such as a large obsidian outpost around 2000 blocks from spawn, during the time when a Spanish YouTuber joined) and dealing peacefully with other groups.

The Emperium, nowadays, has stuck to what has kept it active and successful, building bases and dealing with other groups when it needs to. This included major contributions to the creations of the United Group Embassy. The Emperium is currently over four years old.

### Empire's Edge
{{Main|Empire's Edge}}
Around October–November of 2017, The Emperium decided that it needed to create a base to test some of its newly semi-trusted members. The base originally housed only around 5 people. These members built the foundations of the base.

After a few months, the base's purpose evolved. The small amount of people invited quickly grew to around 15, and the base rose in stature and design. Unique builds began to shape the area and each person's individual project marked Empire's Edge with their own forms of creativity. The base quickly grew into the largest and most active base in The Emperium's history, with a total of 18 people being invited.
Around March of 2018, the base hit its highest amount of activity, with over 10 people online and helping build at once, leading to the largest builds. The base notably lacked a connecting theme between its builds.
On May 17, 2018, the base's coordinates were leaked to the 2b2t subreddit. Emperium members quickly got online and removed the various amounts of equipment and duplicated items that were there, as fast as possible, while several other members guarded the highway to the base itself, holding off anyone who may have had the intion of attacking the base before the Emperium destroyed the base themselves.
Empire's Edge lasted from October 2017 to May 2018.

### The Slaughter of Visionary
The small group previously known as the Visionary Organization was the first major group to directly challenge The Emperium. Their leader, Sinatra, was fond of a discarded Emperium member known as Simplybob. Simplybob was sour over the constant harassing and theft when he interacted with Emperium members, so he convinced Sinatra to act in a hostile manner towards the group. After being insulted and kicked from the group's Discord server, the Emperial leadership at the time came up with the idea to inside Visionary and force them to disband. In about two weeks, coordinates were obtained and they set out to grief their sub-tier capital. A few days later the second pair of coordinates were obtained and a second base was griefed.

### The "Vo-Perium" War
The [Vortex Coalition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vortex_Coalition) and The Emperium were often hostile. Initially, they both, for the most part just ignored each other, but tensions rose to a much higher level after some deaths at spawn and a few insults thrown around, causing both sides to begin a full on conflict. On December 21, 2017, VoCo took the first step and declared the "Vo-Perium" war. However, there is more history than just two groups not getting along.

On January 23, 2017, a group named "[Singularity](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Singularity)" was born, spawning after the second Phase of VoCo came to a close. Many members of VoCo had felt that the group they had grown with had become simply a bad meme and split off from it, creating Singularity. After Singularity was formed, they allied with the Emperium (sometime in late February) and brought with them a general disliking towards VoCo. This distaste heightened even further after [AmericanOreo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AmericanOreo) threatened Singularity's leader, [HolyBruhBrine](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HolyBruhBrine), by pretending to have his dox, forcing him to leave the server. Most of Singularity's members left the disbanded group and fled to the Emperium.

Despite these events, the Emperium still didn't actively try to destroy VoCo. For the most part, they just bought time and continued to gain strength until they could do so.

This changed when Coltsnid and TheDark_Emperor began bad-mouthing each other, which quickly resulted in conflict. However, after about a couple weeks, almost nothing had been done. VoCo released videos of the destruction of Emperial bases, and Emperium blew up a couple small VoCo outposts, though, for the most part nothing had been done. This awkward standoff lasted around 2 weeks, both sides unable to do any real damage to the opposition. Eventually both sides began to give up and with the catalyst of a formal apology from VoCo relating to the dox threat from months prior, both groups put aside their differences to create The VoPerium alliance.

Eventually, despite not having started as the closest of allies, the Vortex Coalition and The Emperium formed the powerhouse alliance known as "VoPerium". This was initially meant to reduce tensions between both sides, but after seeing how well both sides meshed together and cooperated, an official alliance was made, thus creating one of the most powerful forces to ever exist on 2b2t.

Due to miscommunication and VoCo members creating drama, the VoPerium alliance came to an end on the 26th of June, 2019.

### The Nine-Month War with Infrared
About two weeks prior to the Vo-Perium war (around early December 2017), the Emperium formed an alliance with two newly formed groups known as [Inferno](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Inferno) and [Asylum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Asylum). Around this time, The Emperium was actively trying to form alliances with smaller groups and help them grow and protect them from potential attacks. The Emperium connected particularly quickly with Asylum, forming friendships and even sharing members as their alliance grew stronger. This was not the case for Inferno. The Emperium quickly began to detest Inferno and their generally immature and annoying attitude, to the point where after about a week into their alliance, several insiders were planted in Inferno.

Within the day, an Inferno base was griefed, causing the Inferno leader, [Racewizard](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Racewizard), to side with The Emperium because "The Emperium was clearly the winning side". He then handed over the remaining five main bases of Inferno, all of which were griefed the next day. Around this time, tensions began to grow with VoCo and with Inferno destroyed, the Emperium was feeling confident confronting an old enemy. Although Inferno disbanded, quickly they reformed into modern day [Infrared](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infrared), and immediately officially declared war against the Emperium, starting a war that has continued for eight continuous months.

Although Infrared sided with VoCo in the VoPerium war, they did not attempt to make peace when the other parties decided to. The Emperium's conflict with Infrared continued, and although Infrared was persistent, they seemed almost unable to do any kind of damage to The Emperium. Infrared was constantly losing PvP battles at spawn and getting almost all of their newly established bases insided and griefed, yet they continued. After the formation of the [United Group Embassy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/United_Group_Embassy), the Emperium attempted to make peace with Infrared, inviting them into the U.G.E. Ultimately, it didn't work as Infrared rejected the offer and griefed the collective group embassy base. Although everything valuable was removed from the base prior to the grief, the other members in the U.G.E. mutually agreed to hostile relations towards Infrared.

This powerful alliance of 14 groups and a collective total of 100+ members posed an impossible challenge for Infrared. Although they attempted to inside the U.G.E. through a former ally [Unidad](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Unidad), Infrared proved incapable of hurting such a foe. This resulted in the creation of the [Alpha Alliance](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Alpha_Alliance). Made up of the Peacekeepers, Infrared, and [Highland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highland). The Emperium, who had already helped defeat the Peacekeepers and proved that Highland was no threat to them, didn't require much help from the U.G.E. to crush any hopes AA had of posing a threat. The three already weakened groups could barely scrape together five active fighters at spawn, while The Emperium and U.G.E. representatives broke twenty several days in a row. Even with the collective effort, Infrared proved little match for the Emperium.

Thus begins the Sixth Incursion. With a weakened Alpha Alliance, the Emperium shifted its focus to helping the Incursion thrive. Being the military arm, it provided constant support to the other groups in the Incursion, helping build the wall while also helping kill anyone who attempted to thwart the plans of the Incursion at spawn. The Alpha Alliance took a bold step and attempted to face off against the combined might of the Incursion, but proved absolutely useless. With the constant slaughter at spawn and the negative coverage coming from [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit), AA quickly fell. The Peacekeepers grew inactive once more and Highland began to fight with Infrared.

As the Sixth Incursion came to a close, The Emperium attempted to go back to normal activities, building at [Empires Edge](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Empires_Edge) and creating a new base with recruits, trying to ignore and put aside the prior actions of Infrared. Although the war hadn't ended, for about two weeks, very little happened. That is, until Emperiums "Zeta Base" was leaked by Lex, an insider from Infrared. After nearly six months of fighting, the first negative blow to the Emperium was dealt. Although the way the base was leaked had been easily preventable, it still proved the Emperium wasn't invincible. However, no real damage had been done as the Emperium was able to remove all valuables before the attack.

After this, the war continued and over the course of the months until early July 2018. Infrared decided it was in their best interests to attack a VoCo outpost, causing the Emperium and VoCo alliance to strengthen, thus beginning the "VoPerium V Infrared War".

The VoPerium alliance was strong and despite the unneeded help from VoCo, it proved to be unbeatable. Infrared, after just a week and a half of fighting this immense combined power, shattered and was officially disbanded. Ex-Infrared members still hold a hatred towards both of these groups, but they involve mild skirmishes around spawn at the very most. Slowly, the name Infrared faded into 2b history.

### Downfall
Around December of 2019, The Emperium started to become less active on 2b2t, due to general hate from the community as the group became more PVP focused and got involved in a lot of drama with other groups and players.

Some notable players, such as [FamilyPumpkin6](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FamilyPumpkin6), left the group around this time. This only accelerated its decline, and the group started shifting from 2b2t to other anarchy servers. On top of this, multiple coordinate exploits during this time period caused many Emperium bases and stashes to be griefed. But the straw that broke the camel's back was the [Phobos backdoor.](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Phobos_Incident)

Phobos was a popular PVP client, and due to Emperium becoming more of a PVP focused group in 2020, many of its members, including many high ranking members who had access to a lot of classified content, downloaded the client. So when Phobos turned out to be backdoored, a great part of The Emperium's chat logs on Discord got leaked, which included base and stash coordinates. Real life information concerning many of the members was also leaked. Due to this incident, an estimated 70% of the active players in the group quit in the following days. This included JumpyBlaze, the leader of the PVP division. In retaliation, some Emperium members attempted to doxx the people responsible for the backdoor, but these actions proved futile and caused even more people to leave the group out of fear of being doxxed. Since then, what's left of the group has declared itself "inactive" similar to what the [Vortex Coalition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Vortex_Coalition) had done for several years up to that point. Emperium has effectively died and holds no real power anymore. Many of its members have either joined other groups, gone solo, or just quit 2b2t altogether.

Many more members left the Emperium after many "suspicious" actions in the discord from the pvp members.

### Revival
Emperium was revived by TheDark_Emperor in early March 2022 with some old members and many new. Sometime in early May 2022 they held a 0 0 nether spawn event which turned out to be very peaceful with many players showing up. In October 2024, Emperium established a Halloween-themed base with the intention of publicly revealing it on Halloween. The endeavor was a major success, leading to a surge in recruitment. Emperium now actively hosts events for holidays and PvP, further solidifying its presence on 2b2t.

## Trivia
*The group, like some other groups and features from 2b2t, draws its name from Warhammer 40k.
*The group's spelling is derived from the leadership genuinely misspelling it. When they realized the blunder, they kept it to give the group more of a unique identity.

**EveryoneBase** is a community building project founded by [Joey Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut). The purpose was to bring together members of the 2b2t community from every group on the server, to putting aside differences and build together.

## History
### Foundation
The base was started By Joey_Coconut in October 2023.

### Base
EveryoneBase was a community base established in October 2023 by Joey_Coconut. Although its lifespan was brief, it witnessed the participation of over eighty members of the 2b2t Community from a diverse range of groups. Members of many of the server's most established groups, such as The Spawnmasons, Donfuer, BackstreetBoys, SpawnBuilders Association, VEA, GreyBeard Geezers, and many others, collaborated on the project. Players with prior grudges set aside their differences and agreed to collaborate. For those involved it was a significant milestone to be able to work together without issues.

### Destruction & Aftermath
The base lasted only 3 days, and was destroyed by [The Fifth Coulumn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column). Other bases are planned for the future, despite differences between Groups

The Dispenser Exploit was a crash exploit discovered in early February 2021 by the [Brownmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Brownmen).

## History
The exploit involved players placing a dispenser-block at build limit upward and placing a filled shulker-box in it. Once activated with for example a button, the dispenser moved the box above build-limit. This caused the server and client to instantly crash. The same exploit could also be used at the void, with a dispenser facing down into the void. The exploit was utilized on different anarchy servers, most notably on 2b2t by player [romtec](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/romtec). After the server was down for an hour, the exploit was patched.

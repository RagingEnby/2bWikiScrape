}}**Space Valkyria 4** (aka **Space Valk 4**) was the 5th and final Space Valkyria base. It was constructed by [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa) in late 2020 and lay dormant from then to early 2023 when it was griefed.

## History
### Move From Space Valkyria 3
Space Valkyria 4 was founded by [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa) in May 2020, shortly after [Dogucanadal](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dogucanadal) found [Space Valkyria 3](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_Valkyria_3). The relocation efforts to Space Valkyria 4 were conducted quickly and without incident, although the majority of the members of SV3 were inactive, and so only Jacktherippa, [AlphaComputer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlphaComputer), [HermeticLock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HermeticLock), and [Llane](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Llane) came to SV4.

### Construction
Jack was the sole contributor to the base, building intermittently in 2020. While there, Jack built the beginnings of the main build at the base - a futuristic quartz structure. He also built a floating terracotta villa nearby, and planned to shift his usual palette to include terracotta in the major builds at the base. However, Jack quit [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) in late 2020 after becoming disillusioned with the server and instead began streaming the continued construction of Space Valkyria 3 in a creative world. This caused the rest of the basemates to either abandon the base, or quit 2b2t altogether as well. Excepting momentary visits to the base by [AndrewMC12](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AndrewMC12) and [HermeticLock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HermeticLock) in 2022, the base was totally dormant from late 2020 to early 2023.

### Discovery & Self-grief
On March 21, 2023, the base was found by [_xque](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_xque) while base hunting in the [End](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/End). He immediately contacted Jacktherippa for information on the base. Afterwards, he moved the stash. After moving most of the stash over the next 4 days, he shared coordinate-less screenshots of the base publicly, which alerted the public to Space Valkyria 4's existence. This resulted in one of Jack's longtime live-stream moderators, [Universin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Universin), asking for stash in the hopes that it had not yet been moved. After Jack gave Universin the stash, they both gave base coordinates to [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut), who traveled to the base with [smcz19](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/smcz19) to move the stash and also self-grief following further discussion with Jack. They arrived and found most of the stash had already been moved. They completed the stash move and self-griefed the base on March 25, 2023.

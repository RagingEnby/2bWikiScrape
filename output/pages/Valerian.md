## History
In 2018, [HawkedOnFonix](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HawkedOnFonix) and [OldFreeWilly](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/OldFreeWilly) used the area as a temporary building site. Willy decided to invite [BigBatYT](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BigBatYT) after meeting him on the highway. Bat christened the site 'Valerian'.

After the grief of [Exposition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Exposition) and [Builders Haven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Builders_Haven)'s final stash, Hawk invited [1Charlie3](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/1Charlie3) to move items with him to the safety of Valerian. Builder's Haven disbanded; [Cloverfrost](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cloverfrost), [xX_Regicide_Xx](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xX_Regicide_Xx), [R2bEEaton](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/R2bEEaton), [GTHESUPERMAN](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/GTHESUPERMAN) and [The_GenderBender](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_GenderBender) joined soon after, with [Bluerr](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bluerr) staying as a guest.<br />

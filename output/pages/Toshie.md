**Toshie** is a 2b2t player who is the chief architect of [Wintermelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Wintermelon) and [Summermelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Summermelon). As the "Prophet of the Melon goddess", his self-given title, he leads a group of devotees styled the [Followers of Melon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Followers_of_Melon). At Wintermelon and Summermelon, he framed and constructed a significant portion of the city. During the invasion of Wintermelon by the [4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_4th_Reich), he rallied his basemates and tried to organize a defense and negotiate, but his calls were ignored.

Since the griefing of Wintermelon and Summermelon, Toshie has been semi-active on 2b2t, building at [Mu Megabase](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mu) as well as being part of the nascent Mu 2/Autumnmelon before its grief early on in construction.

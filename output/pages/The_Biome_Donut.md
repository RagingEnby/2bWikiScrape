## History
### Founding
wakwak90 founded the base on May 11, 2019, and invited a few people to help him build. Unfortunately, none of them built very much and it was mainly a solo base for wakwak90. He built some buildings in a small town, then began work on the large torus. He also built a Bin Laden [mapart](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/mapart) nearby in July. Once the Torus was completed, he felt it seemed empty and decided to put a Jesus statue in it.

### Leak, Grief, and unwanted Fit video
Soon, wakwak90 grew bored of the base and decided to post a picture of it on Reddit so someone could come grief it with him, and he could move on to new projects. Only one person, MatteaMonster, coordinate exploited it and came to grief the build with him. It was destroyed on October 19th, 2019 A while after the griefed base was posted on the subreddit, Fit made a video on it. wakwak90 later stated in an interview that Fit never even talked to him before he made the video, and that all the information in the video was directly from wakwak90's Reddit post.

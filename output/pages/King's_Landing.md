**King's Landing**, also known as the IDMM, was a large group base. It was founded by [OreMonger](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Oremonger), [Drewbookman](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Drewbookman), and [Branillon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Branillon) sometime in June of 2015

## History
After the events of [the third incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Incursions) , Oremonger and Branillon decided to head far away from spawn and build King's Landing. The name of the base was voted on by the invited members, with Branillon coming up with the winning name (The name was potentially a reference to Game of Thrones). The base constructed was enormous with several projects being done.

The peace, as with most bases on 2b2t, did not last with the members as [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan) accidentally leaked the base in the public chat while trolling Oremonger. Oremonger and [SilverKrownKing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SilverKrownKing) ended up having to destroy the base as they knew it was only a matter of time before someone else destroyed it. In April 18 of 2016, iTristan and the members of [the Tyranny](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc) eventually re-griefed the base during the [Week of Destruction](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Week_of_Destruction), using a admin-modified End Portal built in in the recently-griefed [Space Valkyria 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_Valkyria_2) to quickly get there.

## Architecture
The base had multiple personal builds of the 20 members. Builds included, AwesomeGuyMonkey's treehouse, Caleesii's giant castle, futuristic houses, a large dragon, pixel art, a hand with a levitating ball, several automated farms and Oremonger's auto 265 item sorter, the first one ever seen on 2b. This sorter operated using a glitch in Minecraft that is named "glass elevator" in which items are pushed through glass blocks and flow into hoppers and chests.

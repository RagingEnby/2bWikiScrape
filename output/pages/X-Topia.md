## History
### Founding
As a new player DarkXL6 bought a few items from some shops that wouldn't be obtainable to him in the millions then set out to the base's location. Once there, he gathered raw materials and eventually duped them and built up an enormous amount of wealth. He built alone for a few months then eventually invited traisky which he met in a builder discord. Shortly thereafter, dr_lawlz found the base by using chunktrace and decided to settle there, not grief or leak it.

### Leak and grief
On January 24, 2020, FamilyPumpkin6 had his pearl loaded to the base near spawn. Lord_Mahan was able to get coords to the base via the pearl exploit, and sent them in a groupchat with his friends. This groupchat was insided, and the coords were leaked to [The Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Backstreet_Boys), who subsequently griefed the base one day after the base's 1 year anniversary. The BSB claimed that coords were found by a coord exploit due to the quad spawner found right at the base, but these claims were quickly disproven.

Many of the builders from X-Topia would continue on to found [Hopen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hopen) shortly after it was griefed.

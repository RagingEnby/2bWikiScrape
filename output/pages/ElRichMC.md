**ElRichMC** is a Spanish YouTuber from Galicia, Spain. He is a very advanced technical and survival player and generally known in Spanish Minecraft events, such as his UHC and SMP "Elitecraft". He is known for bringing an influx of new players, starting the "bean/taco invasion." His YouTube channel can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/ElRichMC).

## History
ElRichMC joined YouTube on March 17, 2012 and has over 598 million total views on YouTube. His most popular [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDzjQMuDRPA) has gained over 5 million views, his video about 2b2t his 5th most popular video with 2.4 million views.

In the stream *Terminando el Incinerador*, he later promised not to return due to racism on the server.

ElRichMC came back to the server approximately on September 2020 under the name "GreatGlorious" and started a 2b2t series with his friend Farfadox. He published the first episode on December 14, 2020.

Again on the server they dedicated themselves to building a base that was accidentally leaked in the video chat, it would be griefed the day the video was published, ElRichMC and Farfadox dedicated themselves to exploring looking for resources, they managed to find some bases and then they made a base supplies to 5k spawn blocks to stock up since they planned to steal things from players doing pvp in the 0 0 of the nether.

They also dedicated themselves to removing the large lava wall that players from [Spawn_Incursions](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Incursions) had made, eliminating the lava wall was one of the steps to create their faction, [ThePeacemakers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ThePeacemakers), This faction formed at that time by ElRichMC and Farfadox known as GreatGlorious and EpicZimbabwe and their friend Dasa96, once the lava wall was eliminated, placed chests with equipment and help instructions, so that players could help other players escape and equip themselves on the server.

Because the series was published years later, most of these "Noobs Stashes" were mostly found before ElRichMC announced their coordinates.

The group was taken over by some players in 2024 although it is not currently active, after other things like going to the end to look for resources and doing pvp in the spawn ElRichMC and Farfadox made their "Definitive Base" the base was shown and until today Their location remains a mystery, being the place where they last disconnected.

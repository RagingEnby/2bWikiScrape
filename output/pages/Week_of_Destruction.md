## History
Despite the name, the "Week of Destruction" actually took place across a month. The Lands and OreMonger's Clock Base were blown up on March 25th, 2016. In April, they manipulated [georgebush420](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/georgebush420) into helping them grief numerous bases. The last grief of the "Week of Destruction" was the destruction of KGB on April 20th, 2016.

**The Dark Mirror** was a build project by [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) built in [Kallie's Gape](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kallie%27s_Gape), the giant world edited hole created by [ITristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ITristan), near [Imp's Base 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imp%27s_Base_2). This was the only place on the server that could house a build going from Y-level 1 to Y-level 256.

## History
As far back as 2021, [D loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_loaded) had been considering the idea of building something "upside down". The inverted pyramid at [DonFuer 20](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_20) was the first example of something along these lines. In March of 2023, DonFuer needed a new big project to raise the spirits of the group; the time had come to return to this concept. D_loaded designed a massive schematic in single player which featured multiple large, inverted domes. However, it was so large it would require a location which had been mined down to bedrock in order for the build to fit.

The group spent several days searching for a solution before settling on [Kallie's Gape](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kallie%27s_Gape), a giant gape which had been world edited in by [ITristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ITristan) in 2015 but had sat empty since its creation.

### Construction
Due to the sensitive location, construction needed to be fast. [Lukent](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lukent) and [N8TT](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/N8TT) began transporting the necessary build materials a few days prior to the project's announcement. A handful of DonFuer's most trusted members were invited on the 27th of March, 2023. [Darkomier](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Darkomier) contributed the majority of the building, although many other DonFuer members visited and assisted in the construction. The project was finished a month ahead of schedule with no unexpected visitors.

### Aftermath & Destruction
Prior to the project's completion, a name actually had not been fully agreed on and "Project Mirror" was considered just a temporary name. After Darkomier's incredible contribution, the group decided to call the build "The Dark-Mirror" in honor of him.

Despite being released publicly in a reddit [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t_Uncensored/comments/13zn9xs/the_dark_mirror_33123_43023/) and on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=htovLptgdRQ&ab_channel=DonFuer), the build survived a remarkable 3 months without being destroyed. It was finally griefed on July 25th by [Teutonic Order](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Teutonic_Order).

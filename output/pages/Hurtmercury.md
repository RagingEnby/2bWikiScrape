## History
Hurtmercury joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) in early 2020 amid the Covid-19 pandemic. He initially built arenas for [Fight Club](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fight_Club), before forming [Crimson Star](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crimson_Star) with [B0dait](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/B0dait), [fierceben](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fierceben), and [y_a_t_a](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/y_a_t_a). With Crimson Star he built at [Cum Zone](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cum_Zone) and [Cum Zone II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cum_Zone_II) before the group dissolved and merged into [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate). Hurtmercury was made a leader in SBC and helped to lead it through his entry into the [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen). Hurtmercury attended the majority of Guardsmen bases (such as [Adamantium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Adamantium) and [Mediano](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mediano)) before becoming a full member and then becoming a leadership-ranked member and helping to lead there as well. He stepped down following [major disagreements](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen#Leadership_Troubles) in the group, and subsequently took a break from 2b2t. After returning to 2b2t, he built with the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) at such bases as [Vega](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Formative_bases) and [Poppy Town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Poppy_Town). He later built intermittently at [Block Game Babylon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Babylon) before exiting 2b2t altogether.

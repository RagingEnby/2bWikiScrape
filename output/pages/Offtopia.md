**Offtopia** is an [oldfag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/oldfag) who has been playing on 2b2t since the [Facepunch War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Facepunch_War) in early 2011.

## History
### Early History
Offtopia was part of [Judge's group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Judge%27s_group), and helped many [newfags](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/newfags) at spawn. He would hire players from both [the Facepunch Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Facepunch_Republic) and the [4channers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4channers) to assist him in these endeavors. When the THEJudge's group disbanded, Offtopia moved to [the Valley of Wheat](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Valley_of_Wheat) to help [Jaang](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jaang). Offtopia spent a lot of time there, protecting the Valley. He soon invited some of his friends, such as [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2) and [passie05](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/passie05). Following the foundation of [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria), Offtopia moved to base there. He participated in all of the first three [incursions](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Incursions). When Valkyria disbanded, Offtopia built bases with many former members of the group. He eventually joined [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit), one of his third incursion comrades, amidst the [Rusher Events](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Rusher_War).

### Post-Rusher activity and drama
Offtopia distanced himself from Fit and his group because he thought that Fit leaked the coordinates of the [Crystal Islands](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crystal_Islands) to [Rusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rusher). Offtopia additionally realized that the '[Team Veteran](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Veteran)' vs '[Team Rusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Rusher)' narrative was perpetuating the involvement of many [newfags](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/newfags) in the first place. Offtopia then constructed [The Drain](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Drain) with some of [Team Aurora](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Aurora) members. Fit appeared at The Drain and made a video touring it, in which he explained he had used [ChromeCrusher's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ChromeCrusher) bedrock coordinate exploit.  Fit declared he would not give away the coordinates and that he just wanted to get Offtopia's attention, as they had ceased communications leading up to this incident. The Drain was eventually griefed by the [4th Reich](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4th_Reich), who found it independently of Fit.

### Summermelon
Offtopia became a member of [Summermelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Summermelon) in May 2017. jddinger, who was friends with many of the the members of Summermelon, leaked the coordinates to [Rocket Town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rocket_Town). Fit then discovered Summermelon and destroyed the base with the help of [AlphaComputer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlphaComputer), ChromeCrusher and others as revenge for Rocket Town.

### Mu Megabase
After the griefing of Summermelon, Offtopia reached out to [Willyroof](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Willyroof) in July of 2017 to talk about basing with the [Nether Highway Group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nether_Highway_Group), which had just completed the highway to the X+Z+ world corner. The intent was to form a secret society of builders, so Offtopia came up with the name Mu, after the lost continent of legend. [Mu Megabase](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mu) would become Offtopia's home for the next 3 years until the Account Exploit of February 2020. The base was compromised, and Offtopia moved on to a different project.

**Eclipse** is a group that runs large-scale spawn projects on 2b2t, started by [yfua](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/yfua). Most notably, Eclipse constructed a large spawn project, known as the 1st Eclipse, from April 22, 2022 to May 11, 2022.

## History
### Foundation
Eclipse was founded on March 10 2022 by [yfua](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/yfua). The group was originally not a spawn project group. Instead, it was a small hangout server for the promotion of activities in spawn, like [iPeanuts21](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iPeanuts21)'s Spawn Fight Club. The group was closely allied with the [Spawn Builder's Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builder%27s_Association), as yfua was highly ranked in [SBA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SBA). Eclipse had several small bases at the time which were quickly abandoned in the coming weeks. On March 26 2022, after a short hiatus from the server, [oofplux](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/oofplux) joined the Eclipse discord as a close friend of [yfua](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/yfua). He and [yfua](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/yfua) had a discussion resulting in them both deciding that to revitalize 2b2t, spawn projects that attracted new players' attention would have to be created. A short while later, [oofplux](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/oofplux) presented a project idea to yfua that became the 1st Eclipse.

### 1st Eclipse
After the initial project idea was pitched, [oofplux](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/oofplux) added his friends [IronException](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IronException) and [Dawnfall_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dawnfall_) to a groupchat regarding the project. [IronException](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IronException) helped revise the project idea, and a couple weeks later, the project was set in stone. The group would, try to keep new players from escaping Nether spawn with a few tricks:

# exploiting Minecraft Nether Portal mechanics
# Adding additional layers on the obsidian roof of the Nether to prevent portals from spawning
# Building a wall at a 256 radius of Nether Spawn (to do this, the obsidian roof at y 120 was also extended from a 200 radius to a 256 radius).

The project had 125 total contributors, and 14 main contributors. The project in total took around 1 million obsidian, with the large majority of this being placed manually. Eclipse had many opponents, the main being [Anti Eclipse](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Anti_Eclipse) led by [maksitaxi](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/maksitaxi). Because of this, the first Eclipse was never fully completed, however [oofplux](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/oofplux) released a list of 400 players that were allegedly killed by members of Eclipse throughout the project. [Yfua](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Yfua) quit 2b2t shortly after the first Eclipse was completed, causing the directors to assume full leadership of the group.

### Structure
The group purposely keeps a limited amount of members to maintain a tight knit community and an honest group of players. The group has 2 main ranks: Associate, and Prospect. Associate is the rank representing a fully fledged member, and Prospect is the group's candidate rank. There are also the Directors ([oofplux](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/oofplux), [BryceDey](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BryceDey), and [IronException](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IronException)) who became the administrators of the group after yfua quit playing 2b2t.

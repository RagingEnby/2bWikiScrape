**KILLAQUEEN123** is a builder who joined the server in early 2020. He is the current leader of [Outlast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Outlast) and a former leader of [The Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Imperials) 2b2t branch.

## History
### Early History
Initially a pvper, KILLAQUEEN123 joined 2b2t in April 2020 after growing bored of pvping on clone servers. KILLAQUEEN123 initially did not interact with the 2b2t community much and opted to keep to himself, taking frequent but short breaks from the server as the pvp scene on clone servers began to grow. He later moved fully to 2b2t after quitting crystal pvp.

### Imperials & Outlast
In early 2022, KILLAQUEEN123 joined [The Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Imperials). The relationship between the group and KILLAQUEEN123 was initially tense owing to a history of Killa griefing and insiding on clone servers, however she still quickly became a leader within the group alongside [Nigerianprince](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nigerianprince), with whom he built at bases such as the Spawnforts and also the [Imperial Capital](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperial_Capital). In March of 2023 after many internal disputes with Imperial Leadership, KILLAQUEEN123 left [The Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Imperials) and founded [Outlast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Outlast) with Nigerianprince, subsequently bringing many handpicked Imperials members along with him.

### Donfuer
In early 2023, KILLAQUEEN123 joined [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer), briefly building at some of their spawnbases. In June 2023, he was removed from the group (as well as [Collective](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Collective) after being labeled an insider by DonFuer leadership following [Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys) griefing both a spawnbase owned by DonFuer and also [Ko8efanboy's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ko8efanboy) wedding base.

# Y_a_t_a

**y_a_t_a** is a newfag builder who joined the server in May of 2020, and has participated in a wide variety of projects.

## History
### First Days
y_a_t_a  joined the server in may of 2020, and initially was not comfortable with the idea of joining any established groups on the server.
They spent their first few days building small structures around spawn, but got bored and went around a million blocks out and started a base called [Uranos](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Uranos).

### The foundation of Uranos
*Main article: [Uranos](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Uranos)*

Uranos started as a small island village, and the first structure was a simple cobblestone house, with a few chests. The next thing that was constructed was the mine that went down to bedrock, y_a_t_a wound up mining a lot of the underground out and decided to build something similar to [Boedecken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Boedecken). Basemembers later referred to this  as yatas "Dollarstore Boedecken".
y_a_t_a spent several weeks mining the underground out by hand, and eventually there was space to start building. The underground consisted of two islands covered with trees, a dome, a storage area and two small houses. After this was completed, they moved back up to the surface, where they built an artificial island and a build known simply as the retard dome.
Soon however they grew bored of building alone after two months and /killed back to spawn.

### Return to spawn
y_a_t_a didn't have much gear or food, so their first priority was find some. After a few days, they found a small spawn stash, they gave out kits and food to fellow new players, but stopped when one of the new players attempted to kill them after receiving a kit.
At spawn one day, they saw a map art promoting an event called [Fight Club](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fight_Club) and decided to join the discord, and attended several of their events, eventually making some friends who helped make a group that came to be [Crimson Star](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crimson_Star).

### Crimson Star

Together with the rest of Crimson Star, they built several fight club arenas, most notably the ufo arena. Getting bored rather quickly with only building arenas, y_a_t_a and [Hurtmercury](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hurtmercury) looked around spawn to start a spawn base. About this time, y_a_t_a began their [Mew spaming](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Memes#Mew_spam), which inadvertently helped Crimson Star to attract new members.
There were quite a number of good spots found, but one spot stuck out among them. There stood a griefed castle that wasn't easily recognizable, and they set about restoring it, it was only after they'd rebuilt the walls and laid some grass inside did they realize where they were.
A video had popped into Hurtmercury's recommended on YouTube by [kingoros](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/kingoros), and the base that they had found was his groups base; it was [Base Nostalgia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Base_Nostalgia). They decided to restore the base. This base was rebuilt three times by Crimson Star, and kingoros himself later came to the base.
After the first grief of base nostalgia, Crimson Star moved migrated to several new locations in succession. The bases they founded were: [Cum Zone](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crimson_Star#Cum_Zone), [Cum Zone II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cum_Zone_II), [Transylvania (later renamed Cum Zone 3)](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crimson_Star#Post-Cum_Zone_II), and [Ejaculation Station](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crimson_Star#Post-Cum_Zone_II),  although after Cum Zone II there was a considerable drop in activity at the bases. There was an attempt to rejuvenate Crimson Star; a rebuild of [Boatmurdered](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Boatmurdered), but it wasn't enough to keep the group going. The final project was another Base Nostalgia rebuild.

### Tenth Incursion

Between Cum Zone 2 and Transylvania, MrBeast joined 2b2t, and the [Tenth Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tenth_Incursion) was formed. Along with [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut), y_a_t_a helped to lead the incursion, bringing most of Crimson Star to join them. After 2b2t's Admin deleted the enchanting tables a few times, Joey started an incursion base called [The Library](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tenth_Incursion#The_Library), which y_a_t_a built at. it was griefed several times.

### Shortbus Caliphate and Guardsmen
y_a_t_a and a number of Crimson Stars members went on to join other groups and build with them, primarily the [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate). While there y_a_t_a, built at [The Calculator](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate#_The_Calculator), [The Calculator 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate#The_Calculator_2), and a joing base with [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen) called [Adamantium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Adamantium). Following Adamantium, y_a_t_a, along with many other Shortbus Caliphate members migrated to building with Guardsmen. While with the Guardsmen, y_a_t_a built at [Camp Spooky](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Camp_Spooky), [Whistler](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen#Whistler), and [Mediano](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen#Mediano).
Following the grief of Mediano, y_a_t_a invited [i_tri](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/i_tri), hurtmercury and [bread_loafs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/bread_loafs) to Uranos.

### Return to Uranos
With the influx of additional people and materials at Uranos, the base grew in size, with y_a_t_a spending most of their time there. This was not to last, however. Activity at the base died down after a while, and y_a_t_a self-griefed the base to blow off some steam in early July 2021.

### DonFuer
y_a_t_a joined [Donfuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer) and built at [DonFuer 21](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_21) and started a house, but the base was griefed before it could be finished.

### Astral Brotherhood
y_a_t_a was among the first to join Astral Brotherhood, and participated in many of the bases that were to be founded, such as Vega, Astralia, Menegroth, Okab, and Poppy Town, actively participating in building up until mid January 2022, when y_a_t_a left the group. y_a_t_a later rejoined the group in 2023, participating in a number of bases, such as Molaris, oddysea, fort concord, and hexverse.

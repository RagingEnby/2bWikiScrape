Great ideas, but the main problem isn't the layout of the tournaments. It's the competitors. It deals with how much they give a shit about speedrunning and how far they will continue. A majority of the time the competitors will stop giving a shit and that is where the death of the tournament comes in. IAS has been getting lucky and i fear that IAS10 will be the most challenging, but when it comes to newer tournaments, they either get real lucky or they die fast. Multispeedruns did a different kind of tournament too, and that lasted over half the rounds before it died due to people not caring for it anymore. A few other tournaments, also with different kinds, died at the 2nd round mark. WCS died too but it resurrected and got lucky. OSS had the same issue and same luck. It's all about the people, not the tournament. If the people aren't encouraged enough and don't enjoy doing the tournament, they stop caring for it, issues occur and it gets harder and harder to keep it alive and going. So while i like these ideas, i think the main discussion that should be had here is how we can get people, especially newcomers, to give a shit about the tournaments you make and how you can avoid a dead tournament. I got my own ideas when it comes to IAS10, which will happen soon if the scramble doesn't come back to life in the next 2 months, but you guys need to think of ideas too if you want to do speedrun tournaments aswell.

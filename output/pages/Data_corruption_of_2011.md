The Data corruption of 2011 was an event that took place in 2011.

## History
On August 8th 2011 for unknown reasons 2b2t experienced data corruption. A discussion on Facepunch about this topic has been archived, where admin announced that all player data had been erased and some world errors could also be expected. xcc2 even requested the map getting rolled back to a time in July before ‘dupes’ ruined the economy. The incident led to the admin generating a new level.dat file, and thereby changing 2b2t’s seed to -1373982429803982829. Not much more is known about this incident. For unknown reasons the event was placed on May 2011 on [Sato's Timeline](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato%27s_Timeline).

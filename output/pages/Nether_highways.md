**Nether highways** are a series of highways on 2b2t running from (0, 0) in the Nether. The highways have a distinct design and a not entirely documented history. Multiple groups maintain the highways, the most prominent one being the [HWU](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HWU). Aside from the groups, day-to-day travelers also maintain said highways.

{{Highways}}

## General history and highway meta
2b2t’s nether highways are known as a fast method to travel, since one block in the Nether equals eight blocks in the Overworld. The paved highways are made out of obsidian, with guardrails on each side, to avoid griefing.

The main highways are categorized as follows:

# **The Cardinals**: The most frequently travelled on, these highways start at spawn (0, 0) along the major axes (+X, +Z, -X, -Z) and all four are dug until the Nether world border. They are all paved with obsidian until at least the Overworld World Border (Nether X: +3,750,000, Z: 0).
# **The Diagonals:** These highways, much like the major axes, start at spawn (0, 0) and follow the diagonals all the way until the nether world border. All of them are paved till atleast (X: +/- 1,000,000, Z: +/- 1,000,000) in the nether.
# **The Square Ring Roads:** 18 ring roads run around origin running perpendicular to the major axes, with each of the eight legs running from a major axis to a diagonal highway. They are dug in different radii around spawn. The paved highways include (but are not limited to) every one thousand blocks till 30k, followed by 35k, 40k, 45k, 50k, 125k).
# **The Diamond Ring Roads:** Eight ring roads run diagonally from one major axes to another, intersecting a diagonal perpendicularly at half the radius. This allows faster travel around the axes without needed to venture into spawn.
# **The 100,000 x 100,000 Grid:** Built in mid 2023 by HWU, a grid of highways were built with 50,000 blocks of spawn (equivalent to 400,000 in overworld) and consists of 20 highways running on the X axis, as well as 20 highways running on the Z axis, each spaced 5,000 blocks apart on both directions, forming a grid. This allows easy access to any part of the world within 400,000 blocks of spawn.

It is common to see many players on the highways, both maintenance personnel as well as travellers to or from spawn. Multiple [spawnfags](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Social_Classes) fly idle, waiting for unsuspecting [newfags](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/newfags) to come into their render distance on the highways to massacre them.

## Main axis achievements/history
The main axis highways extend from 0,0 to each of the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, and west) to the [overworld](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Overworld) world borders. Main axis highways are 3.75 million blocks or 3.75 kilometres long.

### +X (East)
* **March 26, 2017:** The +X axis highway has always been at the forefront of highway development due to it being the most travelled highway. It was the first highway to reach 1,000,000 in the Overworld when it was dug primarily by omaliymix in 2012, as detailed in [THEJudgeHolden](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/THEJudgeHolden)'s comics. The highway was the site of [Byrnsy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Byrnsy)'s mission to reach the Overworld [world border](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/world_border) (see [his album](https://imgur.com/a/NgU9E)), which his group the [Nether Highway Group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nether_Highway_Group) achieved.

* **March/April 2020:** IIS paved the highway up to 125k in the Nether.
***August/September 2020:** MEG widened the tunnel to 3×3 up to the Overworld world border.
***December 14, 2020:** HWU extended the obsidian-paved highway to 1 million out in the Nether.
***June 2021:** The Nether world border (30,000,000 blocks out) has been reached with a 1x2 tunnel.
***April 2021:** MEG extended the +X 6x4 to 3.75M (Overworld world border)
***July 2021:**  HWU extended the obsidian-paved highway to the Overworld world border.
### -X (West)
* **December 23, 2017:** -X was dug in 1x2 format.
* **February 2020**: MEG finished the highway to 3.75M (Overworld border) the project took 2 months to complete.
* **February 13, 2021:** HWU extended the obsidian-paved highway to 1 million out in the Nether.
* **February 6, 2025: [SwisherSurgeon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SwisherSurgeon) & [ChiefBeefLoko](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ChiefBeefLoko)** work together to extend the -X Highway from 1 million blocks to the Overworld World Border

### +Z (South)
The +Z Highway was the second highway to reach the Overworld world border following the +X Highway.
* **January 22, 2021**: HWU extended the obsidian-paved highway to 1 million out in the Nether.
* **April 26, 2025** : HWU extended the obsidian-paved highway to the OW World Border.

### -Z (North)
The -Z nether highway is heavily maintained by IIS ([Independent Interstate Society](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Independent_Interstate_Society)) and also to a lesser degree by SIG ([Spawn Infrastructure Group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Infrastructure_Group)) which maintains a high standard for the nether highway until 0, -128,000. The highway consists of 4 wide obsidian blocks with 1 wide guardrail on each side and 3 blocks high just below the bedrock roof. The IIS repairs most griefs on the highway, which makes the -Z nether highway ideal for elytra travel.

The -Z Highway was the last to reach the world border.

* **August 7, 2017:** gRiNdLoRd successfully flew under the nether floor from spawn out to -3.75 million. He was able to get back above the bedrock, build a nether portal, and reach the -Z world border before the -Z highway was completed. Two days later there was a plug-in installed on the server to prevent players from flying under the nether floor. He still has an account there and continues to play around there.
* **February 09, 2021:** HWU extended the obsidian-paved highway to 1 million out in the Nether.
* **February 25, 2025:** HWU extended the obsidian-paved highway to the Overworld World Border

## Diagonal highways history
The diagonal highways extend from 0,0 to each of the four ordinal directions (northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest) to the [overworld](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Overworld) world borders. Diagonal highways are 5.3 million blocks or 5,303 kilometres long. MEG's achievements on diagonal highways can be found [here](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Motorway_Extension_Gurus#Diagonal_highways).

### -X -Z *(North West)*
This was the server's and MEG's first completed diagonal highway which was dug from [spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Nether) to the -X, -Z [world border](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/World_Border).
***May 26, 2020:** -30M, 30M world border was reached. This dig was completed by Citadel2222, [illville502](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/illville502), VeryVon, DantezWrath, KevinKC2014, and harritaco.
### +X +Z *(South East)*
This was the server's and MEG's second completed diagonal highway, which was dug from [spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Nether) to the +X, +Z [world border](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/World_Border).

* **June 2017:** 35k - 135k was dug primarily by [BoomerangVillage](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BoomerangVillage) and [Breithan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Breithan).

***September 4, 2020:** 30M, 30M world border was reached. This dig was completed by KevinKC2014, Jonanen, harritaco, Paragon, and 5K5K.
### +X, -Z *(North East)*
This was the server's and MEG's third completed diagonal highway, which was dug from [spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Nether) to the +X, -Z [world border](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/World_Border).
***October 14, 2020:** 30M, -30M world border was reached. This dig was completed by illville502, Citadel2222, and [tycrek](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/tycrek).
### -X, +Z *(South West)*
This was the server's and MEG's fourth and final completed diagonal highway. The completion of this highway marks all diagonal highways dug to the world border at MEG's 3x3 minimum tunnel size.
***March 6, 2017**: 65k was reached.
***February 13, 2021:** -30M, 30M world border was reached. This dig was completed by Roy4lRondi, tycrek, Citadel2222, Juderenee, jumboman32, Parzi and Duke_Arktouros.

## Rings Roads (RR)
Ring roads encircle 0,0 in a square shape, hence their name. Dozens of these roads exist at various intervals. They are used for traveling out from the main axis or diagonal highways to more remote areas. They are also commonly used to avoid 0,0 by going around it. For most of their existence, these were just bare Netherrack tunnels, sometimes 1x2 sized. In their obsidian form, the larger ring roads around 5K, 10K, 15K, 25K were originally constructed by the [Independent Interstate Society (IIS)](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Independent_Interstate_Society_(IIS)), and are now being expanded by the Motorway Extension Gurus (MEG) and maintained by the Highway Workers Union (HWU). MEG added more ring roads further out such as 125K, 250k, 500k, 750K, 1Million, 3.75Million (World Border ring road) connecting all axis world border monuments and world corners to one another.

### Nether spawn region (100K overworld / 12.5K nether)
* **1000 (1Krr):** One ring road that is well-known today is the ring road which was built 1000 blocks away from 0,0 and was toured by [BarrenDome](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BarrenDome) in a YouTube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irJFIadoLCo&ab_channel=BarrenDome).

## Diamond Highway
[The Nether Diamond Highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Workers_Union#The_Diamond_Highway) is another ring road that connects all straight highways at 50k from spawn (crossing the diagonals at 25k), but it is rotated by 45 degrees compared to the regular ring roads. Its purpose is to reduce traveling time if killing back to spawn is not an option.

The 50k and 25k Diamond Highways has been completely dug and paved with obsidian by the [Highway Workers Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Workers_Union) on the 7th of February 2021.

In early 2023, [AlqUU](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlqUU) and [Skai256](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Skai256) initiated a new project with [Highway Workers Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Workers_Union) with the goal of mining 125k, 250k, and 500k diamond roads. They successfully mined these roads in less than a month, and you can find the highway map by clicking [here.](https://highways2b2t.net/map.html)

## Honorable mentions
### -4444 Highway
The -4444 Highway starts at the coordinates 0x -4444z and goes in the eastern direction. It extends to 444 thousand blocks in the Nether which equals about 3.6 million blocks in the overworld and several bases were built on its overworld side. It was probably constructed before the [Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rusher_War). This highway is famous among the old players.

### Konata Izumi Road
On May 2021, the Nether World Border was reached using this highway. The road coordinates are: Z: 28500 (28.5k) and Y: 5 Nether.

The length of the road is 30 million blocks, it starts at the southern canal (0, 5, 28.5k) and ends at the Nether world border (30M, 5, 28.5k).

The road was created only by Hare_Hare_Yukai using 2 alts. This project took around half a year to complete and the digging was done in 77 days. A special method of repairing pickaxes was developed during the construction of this road.

Together with the +X Axis Nether Highway, it is the longest road on 2b2t.
### Point Less highway
The Highway dug by the [X+ Diggers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nether_Highway_Group) starting at the X+ World Border ([Point Nemo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Point_Nemo)) and goes for 30,000,000 Overworld blocks to the X+ Z+ World Corner (Point Less) become known as the first highway to connect an axis world border base to the world corner. This Highway also has many monuments and milestones. It is currently a part of the 3750000 ring road.

## Griefing
Since 2019, many withers have been placed from 0 to 50k. However, all of the potholes from the withers have been restored by the IIS and the withers remain on the floor of the nether. As of October 2022, the highway is in great condition and the withers pose no real threat to any traveller. There are spawn PvP groups who are active, making quick work of anyone at 0,0, as well as the constant flow of repairs on the highway by the [Highway Workers Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Workers_Union). In March 2022, bots were spotted griefing the highways, by mining blocks from the highway and and placing them on the highway, making them difficult to travel on. These bots have since been deactivated.

In April 2023, a group started by [ChiefBeefLoko](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ChiefBeefLoko) called the [Highway Removers Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Removers_Union) was founded. Since ChiefBeekLoko had beef with [AlqUU](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlqUU), a fellow member of the [Highway Workers Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Workers_Union), he sought to remove him from the group. [ChiefBeekLoko](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ChiefBeekLoko) initiated griefing on the highway, expressing the intention to continue until [AlqUU](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlqUU) was expelled from the [Highway Workers Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Workers_Union). However, [AlqUU](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlqUU) remains a member of [Highway Workers Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Workers_Union) despite these actions. Their goal was to do massive damage to the Nether Highways around spawn. They did significant damage to the rings roads around Nether Spawn as well as placing many withers within 50k of Nether spawn on the 8 main roads. These withers have since dug down to below the roads, and the damage repaired. The Highway Removers Union has since disbanded.

## Trivia
The total distance of the highways is about 431,305,000 blocks, of which 22,828,700 (~5.3%) are paved. This is enough to circle the Earth's equator 10.76 times in the nether, or bridge to the Moon and 12.2% back. 2b2t's highway system ranks 21st compared to the total road distance of real countries, between Turkey and Poland. Taking overworld distance, the nether highways ranks 4th, between China and Brazil.

The equivalent Overworld distance is 3,450,440,000 blocks, which is enough to bridge 9.08% to Venus.

## History
### The Samaritans and Founding
Angband was founded Jan. 1st 2020 by [LordGalvatronMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/LordGalvatronMC) as a base for his group, the [Samaritans](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Samaritans). The base was centered around a cliff on the edge of a mesa spike biome. The structure/name itself was inspired by the fortress Angband from J. R. R. Tolkien’s [The Silmarillion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion). The base palette/theme was a continuation of the style of LordGalvatronMC’s [Malachor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Malachor) series of bases. Initial clearing/terraforming of the terrain was completed in the first few days by LordGalvatronMC, [NickNove](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NickNove), and [Steveythekid](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Steveythekid) with initial base construction starting on Jan. 4th. While LordGalvatronMC worked on the main area, Steveythekid built a quarry for mining stone and other materials in the jungle nearby. Angband continued as a Samaritans project until being put on hold on Feb. 2nd 2020 by LordGalvatronMC to focus on recruitment for the group. Angband was totally abandoned shortly thereafter when the Samaritans became fully inactive. While the base was inactive, [NetherRad](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NetherRad) discovered it while base hunting.

### The Return and Blackguard
On April 19th 2021, [LordGalvatronMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/LordGalvatronMC) restructured his group, the [Blackguard](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Blackguard), into a base discord for Angband and revived the location. [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) and [Medieval](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Medieval) were subsequently invited a week later. LordGalvatronMC continued working on the base, mainly clearing out mesa spikes and mining out space for an underground cavern with a bridge across. He continued by terraforming the area between the outer and inner walls featuring hellish lava pits with corrupted trees growing, and then terraforming the terrain beyond the main front gate. He invited [Jelooboi](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jelooboi) on Aug. 1st 2021. Jelooboi built a library for his various books connected to the inner walls in late 2021.

### Expansion and Discovery
In November 2021, [LordGalvatronMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/LordGalvatronMC) started expanding the base into the nearby jungle biome to build a logging camp near where [Steveythekid](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Steveythekid) had built his quarry. He would continue working off and on until Dec. 23rd 2021, when [xrayessay](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xrayessay) found the base while exploring. Thinking the base to be abandoned, he also showed [Harrissssonn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Harrissssonn) the location. Shortly thereafter on Jan. 4th 2022, [jddinger](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jddinger) also found the base while exploring; he invited [Terbin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Terbin). Later that month, [VBence1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/VBence1) also found the base. LordGalvatronMC continued working on the base, inviting many high-ranking [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) members in February after the grief of [Poppy Town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Poppy_Town), although only [smcz19](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/smcz19) arrived at the location. Throughout the rest of early 2022, LordGalvatronMC constructed a ravine area in the rough center of the base inspired by the pits of Isengard from Lord of the Rings, and [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) built two towers on either side of the outer wall of the main castle.

### Later Life and Downfall
[LordGalvatronMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/LordGalvatronMC) continued working intermittently on the base over the course of 2022. On Nov. 10th 2022, [hkk_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/hkk_) found the base while exploring and opted to not grief the base. On November 16, LordGalvatronMC took a world download amidst plans of redesigning the main area in a larger scale. The base went inactive again during the redesign process. Medieval leaked Angband and [Molaris](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#-aris_Bases) to the [Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column) on Feb. 7th 2023 as revenge for [Donfall](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfall). Angband was greifed the following day on Feb. 8th 2023 by [Bezopasan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bezopasan), [Orsond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Orsond), [TakeoutMenu](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TakeoutMenu) and [Zetrax](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Zetrax), believing it to be an [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) base.

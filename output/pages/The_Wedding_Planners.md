## History
### Formation
The Wedding Planners began as a simple event planning group created by [hardboiledmegs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/hardboilednegs), [CirocDrip](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CirocDrip) and [YoMoBoYo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YoMoBoYo) on May 30th 2025.  They had begun planning the group's first event, [Family Feud](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Family_Feud), and Meg created a discord, originally called mep, to help with organizing the event. This eventually grew into a more formal group as they moved forward with more events and invited more people to help create.  The group has currently hosted 4 community events with a variety of groups, including the 2024 [2b2t Oscars](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Oscars).

## Events
### Family Feud
Family Feud planning began mid-May 2024, before the creation of the Wedding Planners discord.  The group created a Google form with 45 questions for anyone in the community to answer, and used the results to form the questions for the game. They received 101 total responses to the questionnaire after sending it around to many groups. The build was made by [MagicEx](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MagicEx), [Capybara](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Capybara), [CirocDrip](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CirocDrip) and [YoMoBoYo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YoMoBoYo) and was a close replica to the original game show stage design.  [P529](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/P529) created 2 maparts per answer, totaling around 650 unique maparts, which were finished despite there being a server rollback which had eliminated 131 completed maparts.  [DuctTapeMessiah](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DuctTapeMessiah), [P529](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/P529), [Skai256](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Skai256), and [Beithir](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Beithir) printed maps in the hours before the event, completing everything on time despite the setback.

The event was held June 28th 2024 between [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood), [Spawnmasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons), [CGI](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CGI), [Narnia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Narnia), [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association) and [Outlast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Outlast).  There were 36 players in attendance, and the event was streamed on [hardboiledmegs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/hardboiledmegs) Twitch stream, accumulating around 60 viewers on average.  In the end, [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) won with 571 points.  Family Feud became the first successful Wedding Planners event.

### 2b2t Oscars
Meg noticed that the 2b2t Oscars had not occurred in 2023 since the host [BachiBachBach](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BachiBachBach) hadn't announced one.  [YoMoBoYo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YoMoBoYo) and [hardboiledmegs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/hardboiledmegs) reached out to Bachi and asked if he planned to come back to host them again, which he declined, but informed the two that they had his blessing to continue the event, even offering up the old Ben discord.  Meg wanted to host her own version of the 2b2t Oscars under the Wedding Planners umbrella.  The planning for the first Oscars began in June with the intention to hold the event in November 2024.

This Oscars event was modeled after the real Academy Awards.  Group leaders were contacted with a list of categories and instructed to nominate one person, event, group etc, per category.  19 group leaders were contacted, and results were tallied by the planning team.  [Warske](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Warske) designed the venue, a sprawling sandstone theatre, and a courtyard featuring flag poles, which were adorned with banners representing every group that participated; 3 copies of the venue were built on the server in some capacity as back up locations.  [P529](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/P529) designed 69 maparts for the winning nominations, which he and [Skai256](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Skai256) printed, while [CirocDrip](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CirocDrip) created kits for the winners with books from TheAcademy and copies of their winner mapart.  88 people participated in game, including all the nominees, all the presenters, most group leaders and significant community members.  Including the red carpet interviews at the beginning of the event, hosted by [BoomerangVillage](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BoomerangVillage) and [MagicEx](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MagicEx), the event lasted 1 hour 37 minutes at the first location before the first crystal was popped, and the remainder of the event took place at the second location thanks to [LegendBake](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/LegendBake) pearling the hosts.  In total the event lasted for 2 hours 34 minutes with a total of 331 live viewers.  The results of the voting from all groups was published in a recap post on Reddit.

### Jeopardy
In March 2025, [hardboiledmegs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/hardboiledmegs) and [lukent](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/lukent) were discussing potential event possibilities and they landed on Jeopardy. The event was structured with 4 contestants: [ChiefBeefLoko](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ChiefBeefLoko), [Godroster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Godroster), [TheK33per](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheK33per), and [Spencer36000](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spencer36000). The contest itself was broken up into two different rounds featuring categories such as guess that banner, 2b2t trivia, guess that base, exploits, etc.

[Warske](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Warske) designed the exterior, modeling it after a real life Hollywood studio set, and [Vethre](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vethre) designed the interior, basing it off the real life Jeopardy set. After the creative design was finished, it was built in-game mostly by [KBGaming](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KBGaming) with help from [KommunistKuba](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KommunistKuba), [Javikia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Javikia), [FIRECATinBLACK](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FIRECATinBLACK), and [hardboiledmegs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/hardboiledmegs). On April 21, 2025, the event was streamed live by Meg and after a little over 90 minutes, [ChiefBeefLoko](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ChiefBeefLoko) won the event. After the event a full recap was posted on Reddit.

### Build Battle
Build Battle was created by [capybara](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/capybara) and hosted by him and [YoMoBoYo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YoMoBoYo).  The premise was simple; 3 rounds starting with 8 teams in the first round, 4 teams in the second round, and a final battle between the top 2 teams in the last round. Contestants were given a theme for each round, and around an hour per round. Teams were given a chest of shulkers of common building materials, with the ability to ask White_Van (aka [P529](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/P529)) for specific extras not on hand.  The judges were capybara and Yomoboyo, judging out of 5 on 3 criteria; aesthetic, storytelling, and creativity. At the end of the battle, teams that returned all their items were given a custom 2b2t Build Battle kit made by Capy.

Capy designed and built wooden frames and custom terrain for each of the three rounds, streaming the event on his twitch stream, lasting over 4 hours and accumulating over 60 viewers at it's peak.  The three rounds were Fantasy, Sci-Fi and the final theme was Organics.  8 teams spanning different groups participated, with first place receiving  20 dubs and prio for each player, and second place receiving 10 dubs.

**The Teams:**
* red team - Javikia and lukent
* yellow team - Negative_Entropy and smcz19
* purple team - KommunistKuba and Nigerianprince
* orange team - VoidedValentine and freaky_soup
* green team - DarkXL6 and BoomerangVillage
* cyan team - Copperator and CirocDrip
* pink team - cs_italy and metalbunny

The final round saw the Yellow team, [Negative_Entropy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Negative_Entropy) and [smcz19](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/smcz19), competing against the Cyan team, [Copperator](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Copperator) and [CirocDrip](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CirocDrip), with the Cyan team taking the win and the dubs after the final scores were tallied.

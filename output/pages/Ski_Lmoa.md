## History
### Early History
Ski_Lmoa first joined 2b2t in March 2023, and he wandered spawn before eventually making his escape through a nether portal.
He built several small houses close to spawn before quitting the server after being griefed multiple times.
Ski_Lmoa eventually returned back to 2b2t a few weeks later and made contact with Vapepens through chat and was invited to [VEA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vapepens_Elite_Alliance).
He built at notable VEA Bases such as [Scoobert Land](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vapepens_Elite_Alliance), where he built his first castle and Dragon Skeleton. After Scoobert Land was griefed, Ski_Lmoa left 2b2t again.

### Return to 2b2t
Ski_Lmoa returned to 2b2t in August 2024 where he would go on to build and attend events with the group for a few months before going on to found and build at [Anthem](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Anthem). Originally made as a base for the VEA, Ski_Lmoa would retain ownership of the base until it was griefed by the Emperium and 5C. Afterwards, due to internal drama, he was kicked from the group.
Upon being kicked from the VEA, Ski_Lmoa went on to join the [Enclave](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Enclave) briefly where he constructed the base [Azula](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Azula) and gave Anthem over to the Enclave upon being initiated into their ranks. A couple months later, Ski_Lmoa was kicked from the Enclave after internal drama and differences between him and the other members.

### Emperium
Shortly after joining the Enclave, Ski_Lmoa was invited to join the [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium) and went on to found the base [Sierra](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sierra), originally inspired by the Capital City: Leyndell from Elden Ring. Sierra consisted of the main entrance and a part of the Leyndell wall. The base lasted several months before eventually being leaked due to internal drama. As a result of being a member of the Emperium, he later was invited to join The [Teutonic Order](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Teutonic_Order) where he went on to help [Takeouts](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Takeouts) manage the group.

#### Pit Fight By Emperium
In early 2025, Ski_Lmoa and [87ac](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/87ac) revived Pit Fight and re-named it to "Pit Fight by Emperium". The first pit fight became a major success, gathering 50+ fighters. In April 2025, he helped host the 2nd Pit Fight.
Ski_Lmoa's main role within Pit Fight is to design the arenas that are used by the fighters to fight in.

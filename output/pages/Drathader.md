**Drathader** is a [newfag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/newfag) who joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) in the summer of 2016, following [Rusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rusher)'s video. He quickly rose up the ranks of multiple groups, and became an avid collector.

## History
### Invictus
Following TheCampingRusher's video, he became a member of the [Invictus Group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Invictus_Group), participating in most of their bases. As a result of this membership, he became good friends with [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut), and the two often based together. Following the doxing of [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids) and the fall of Obliviscaris, Drathader went inactive for some time

### Block Gamers
He came back to [spawnfag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Social_Classes) and become a member of [Ironfarm Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ironfarm_Base) in early 2017. He later joined the [Spawn Masons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Masons) and participated in [Block Game Mecca](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Mecca). [Beardler](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Beardler)'s grief of Mecca was heavily motivated by the theft of items from Drathader's museum in the base. Consequently, Drathader went inactive once again. He returned in late 2020 to build at [Block Game Jerusalem](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Jerusalem)

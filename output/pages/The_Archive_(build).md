**The Archive** was a bedrock sphere created by [The Tyranny](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc) as a main base of operations during the peak of their power in early 2016. It was designed by [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) and [taylo112](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/taylo112) and housed nearly every item in the game, including horrendously powerful [32K Weapons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/32K_Weapons) and otherwise unobtainable items like Barrier blocks. It played a role in the destruction of several major bases during the [Week of Destruction](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Week_of_Destruction), including [The Lands](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Lands), [Space Valkyria 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_Valkyria_2) and [King's Landing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/King%27s_Landing), as members of the Tyranny used it as a staging area.

It was discovered through region files from 2b2t uploaded by [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan) to his tzone account.

The base was active for about two weeks before it was destroyed in late April through [WorldEdit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/WorldEdit) by [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster). YellowstoneJoe visited the location in 2017, although it's been cleared "most entirely", including [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan)'s unsuccessfully placed end portal with incorrect eye placement.

While the giant bedrock sphere was the main section of the base, there's a set of structures in the island beneath it that survive to this day. There's also an underground portal in the nearby ocean that leads to the Nether. The Nether end of the portal is near the roof of the dimension. Before Hausemaster deleted them, there were also a few illegal block structures, mainly made of bedrock.

}}**Cydonia** was a small PvP group that was founded by Killet and mainly focused on recruiting notable PvP players from 2b2t. Most of these players were [spawnfags](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/spawnfags) and had dealings with groups like [Infrared](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infrared) and [Highland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highland).

## History
Cydonia was active roughly around late 2018 and throughout 2019. They would generally be active at spawn, other anarchy servers, and anarchy related PvP servers. The group would have some drama with Infrared, including destroying stashes and fighting with members, however this would later subside. Several of their members were initially in the first [Anti-Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Anti-Incursion) before the group formed and would spearhead the Second Anti-Incursion. The group would go inactive in late 2019, making a small return in July 2020 before eventually being declared a "dead group" by Killet later that year.

## History
### Early History
EBSmc joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) with a friend on February 4th, 2020 after seeing [Fit's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) video on [TeamNoTrees](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TeamNoTrees), finding appeal in 2b2t's anarchy-based community. However, his friend quickly lost interest, leaving him to explore the server on his own for about a month before becoming inactive.{{Source?}}

### Luminous Sandclave
In mid-May 2021, EBSmc returned to 2b2t after seeing Fit's video about the reconstruction of the [Valley of Wheat](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valley_of_Wheat). After traveling there, he met [Vaspelli](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vaspelli), who invited him to the [Luminous Sandclave](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Luminous_Sandclave). He played intermittently in the following months, spending most of his time at the Valley of Wheat or programming.

After the initial [Nocom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nocom) 245k heatmap was released, he contributed to one of the first apps which enabled its easy analysis to calculate the locations of hot-spots displayed.  The quick adoption of this software netted Luminous Sandclave several hundred double chests of materials. The group went inactive after they completed their own rebuild of the Valley of Wheat in 2022.

### Bespin
EBS co-founded [Bespin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bespin) with [Mcmaestro979](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mcmaestro979), [HauseWasHere](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HauseWasHere), and [Splito](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Splito) on September 18, 2021. The base was made in the end to protect from basehunters. It grew to include about half a dozen members before being leaked by [Kanji](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kanji) on a livestream by [Paulsteve007](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Paulsteve007) about 3.5 months later, before being self-griefed by EBSmc and HauseWasHere.

### Spawn Builders Association & Spectrum Builders
He later joined [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association) and [Spectrum Builders](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spectrum_Builders), and contributed to Bepitone software for game modifications.

As of 2023, EBSmc currently has no logged activity, and has been absent from recent Spawn Builders Association events.

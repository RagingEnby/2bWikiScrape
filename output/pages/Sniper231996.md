Sniper231996 is a [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) player from 2016 and former [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium) member notable for founding Sniper's Peaceful Island, Valinor, and other builds, as well as posting artwork on the 2b subreddit in 2017.

## History
Sniper is a 2b2t player from India who joined 26 Dec 2016 and made a few solo bases, before moving on to found larger group bases such as [Sniper's Peaceful Island](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sniper%27s_Peaceful_Island) and more. Sniper made 2b fanart over time, which he posted on the [2b2t subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t). He founded Valinor (both a base, a group, and a discord) in early 2017, and made connections with many players.

Sniper originally started his 2b career with a few solo bases, before creating Valinor I with [Sage_Mathias](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sage_Mathias) and [Redstoner2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Redstoner2b2t). After that base was abandoned, he moved on to start a new base named Valinor (griefed in 2020 by [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013)) and Sniper's Peaceful Island (griefed in 2018 due to [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids) leaking coords to [fr1kin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fr1kin). Sniper then went on to other bases such as [Mokuzai Island](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mokuzai_Island) and Sniper's Peaceful Island 2.

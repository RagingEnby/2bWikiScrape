# _m_o_t_h_r_a_

**_m_o_t_h_r_a_** is a newfag known for basing at [Block Game Mecca](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Mecca), being a member of hte [Spawnmasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons), and being one of the people behind the [100k Mapping Project](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/100k_Mapping_Project).

## History
### Early history
_m_o_t_h_r_a_ joined 2b2t in January of 2017. Like most new players, he spent their first few months building a solo base a few thousand blocks away from spawn, crafting his own gear, and making periodic journeys to spawn. Later, the [Crafting Table Dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Duplication_Glitches) became public, allowing _m_o_t_h_r_a_ (and most other players at the time) to dupe incredible amounts of items quickly, and _m_o_t_h_r_a_ "...actually became wealthy" as a result.

### ParrotBot
Around this time, _m_o_t_h_r_a_ wrote a chatbot (named ParrotBot) that used a learning model to generate fake chat messages for different players. In order to train the bot's learning model, _m_o_t_h_r_a_ reached out to bot owners to ask for chat logs, as bots were online more or less all the time and would have the most data to comb through. [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids) was among the bot owners contacted, and _m_o_t_h_r_a_ soon became good friends with him.

### Rhodes
After being invited to Rhodes by [Drachenstien](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Drachenstien), _m_o_t_h_r_a_ built a house in his signature modern style. Through building there, he became good friends with [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut).

### Block Gamers
Because of his friendships with Slappnbadkids and Joey_Coconut, _m_o_t_h_r_a_ was invited to [Block Game Mecca](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Mecca). _m_o_t_h_r_a_ became a core member of the [Block Gamers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Gamers), while also building at the base. He also cofounded the [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate) with Slappnbadkids and Joey_Coconut while there. After the subsequent migration to [Block Game Jerusalem](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Jerusalem) (largely conducted by _m_o_t_h_r_a_), and the extended break of most of the members, _m_o_t_h_r_a_ stopped being involved with the group for a time. A few months after the re-activation of BGJ, _m_o_t_h_r_a_ returned to the base and built several things, most notably his mushroom house.

### SpawnMasons
Slappnbadkids invited _m_o_t_h_r_a_ into the Spawnmasons. _m_o_t_h_r_a_ has participated in many bases with the group, such as [Smibville](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Smibville), [Cloud Club](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cloud_Club), [COVID-2147](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/COVID-2147) and [Chunk Haven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chunk_Haven).

### 100K OW Mapping Project
Around November of 2018, _m_o_t_h_r_a_ had "a dream to create the largest Minecraft world download of all time." Partnering with others on 2b2t, _m_o_t_h_r_a_ headed up what was then the largest Minecraft world download ever taken, the [100k Mapping Project](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/100k_Mapping_Project). A year after starting on this endeavor, he [posted the WDL on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/dzvq67/presenting_the_2b2torg_100k_mapping_project_world/), getting 2.7 thousand upvotes before the post was archived. As for why this project was undertaken, _m_o_t_h_r_a_ said "We have already data-mined 2b2t in various ways, but I hope that others will do so in creative ways that we didnâ€™t think of."

**2b2tpress** was an anonymous 2b2t media group that posted humorous interpretations of server events on their website.
## History
The 2b2tpress first appeared in the 2b2t community in July of 2016 by originally sharing their articles written on http://2b2t.press with the 2b2t subreddit.

The domain name "2b2t.press" was initially created on July 21, 2016.

## Website + Shitposting
The articles on the 2b2tpress website appeared to be satirical, mostly fake, [shitposts](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/shitposts).

The website was hosted with WordPress blogging software and had a custom or modified theme created by 2b2tpress. The website was (probably) intentionally terribly designed with minimal CSS styling, obnoxious colors, and oddly sized margins. Spelling errors were also a continuous theme with the 2b2t Press website, the articles, and the social media accounts associated with the 2b2tpress. Note the a section from the original footer on the website:<blockquote>website designed by profesionals with latest css3 and html5 technologes</blockquote>Most of the articles written by the 2b2t Press group also contained various terrible stock images with blatantly obvious watermarks. It is assumed that this was to give the posts less of an appeal to logos, as it seems the intentions of the group were to gain attention from how horrible the posts actually were.

## Community Involvement
The 2b2tpress have a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/2b2tpress), [Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/user/2b2tpress), [Minecraft](https://namemc.com/search?q=2b2tpress) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMZOCbePyziwJwdG94RhLzg/) account.

The Reddit account was most active, which is where they shared a majority of their posts with the 2b2t community on the 2b2t subreddit. They responded to many other posts and gave other input on the subreddit as well.

The Twitter account was mostly used to rally attention to the blog posts as well as provide quick updates to followers of the group.

The YouTube account only contains 1 video produced by the group for the 1 year anniversary of [The Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Rusher_War). The video covers the history of the event in a low-resolution PowerPoint presentation given by one of the 2b2t press group members.

According to namemc.com, the "2b2tpress" Minecraft account was changed to "West2020" on 7/4/2020.

## Shutdown Drama
Following the shutdown of their website, the 2b2tpress created a petition on change.org claiming that Verizon had shutdown their services. <blockquote>in december of 2016 our precious website http:/2b2t.press/, which we
spent a lot of time organizing and creating, was shut down by our
providor Verizon.</blockquote>The claim alleged that Verizon had shutdown the 2b2tpress for endorsing then U.S. presidential candidate, Donald J. Trump.

In October of 2017, nearly 1 year after the group's disappearance, the 2b2tpress returned for a short period. A new logo was created and the website was up for a brief amount of time.

It is unclear whether the 2b2t press is still active. The official 2b2tpress Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube accounts have been inactive for some time.

As of July 2020, the 2b2tpress website redirects to James Rustles' YouTube channel. The 2b2tpress Twitter account has [stated](https://twitter.com/2b2tpress/status/1285252207718408192?s=20) that this was unintentional and the domain had been taken from them.

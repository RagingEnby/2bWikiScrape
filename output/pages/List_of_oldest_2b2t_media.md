The following is a **list of oldest 2b2t media**, including videos and screenshots.

## YouTube videos
Although 2b2t did not have a significant YouTube presence in its early years, as there is today, there are many videos scattered around this time period. All known videos from 2012 and before are compiled below. All known videos from [the *Garry's Mod* server](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_(Garry%27s_Mod_server)) are compiled as well from the time it was up. The oldest known video from the *Minecraft* server is a video by TimeCalm dated to April 5–19, 2011, though uploaded to YouTube on July 6, 2011. This video is the only video known to exist from the pre-Facepunch era. The oldest 2b2t video by upload date, however, is widely considered to be chezhead's video of the Facepunch base Fort Creationism Corner. This video’s upload date and historical significance causes it to largely overshadow the existence of the older video.

Additionally, [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpAKsEqj20I) by "ky lan" on April 1, 2011, claims in its description to have been taken on 2b2t. This claim is disputed, however. There is no evidence from the video itself of it being on 2b2t, and the description has been altered, as the original video description didn't include the 2b2t link. The uploader also refuses to respond to questions relating to 2b2t. It is unlisted as of February 12, 2022, and made public as of March 18, 2024.

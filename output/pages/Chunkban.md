A **chunkban**, is an exploit where player(s) are kicked consistently from the server due to an error involving glitched chunks. This is commonly linked to collision corruptions or chunks containing excess data.

Some chunkbans include more features, such as making the affected player invincible to damage, crashing the server, or even removing the priority queue access of anyone who enters the chunkban.

## Methods
* **FPS Lag** - Uses very simple machines, which exploit Minecraft's lighting mechanic. It is Patched when the NoRender module is turned on.
* **Sign** - This method consisted of filling a chunk with 2MB of sign text, this is by far the most efficient chunkban method, therefore patched on most servers
* **7-Layer** - Consisting of the illegal cyto player heads, these could be placed in large quantities in a chunk. Taking around 2,000 to ban a chunk
* **Banner** - Using data rich banners, a chunk can be filled up and banned with around 20-30 Layers
* **Furnace** - This brute force method somehow got under the threshold of actually fitting into a chunk, it requires 44,000 furnaces and cannot fit into (2b2t's) nether
* **E-chest** - a slight improvement on furnaces, but a pain to build with. Ender Chests are only useful when duped on mass and are harder to grief.
* **Enchanting Table** - Very rarely used due to the frame rate issues when building, does not offer much significance over furnaces and E-chests
***Black Hole** - Powerful lag machines that crash 2b2t and remove the priority queue of a player, which are operated by making sand fall slowly through cobwebs.

## History
*Claims of chunkban usage go back far since it has been a bug since the beginning of the game, so feel free to add your experiences here.*

**Early 2018** - Widespread usage of FPS Lag Machines at Spawn to kick players who used a Vanilla Client. [Armorsmith's Followers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith%27s_Followers), [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium), and members of [Block Game Mecca](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Mecca), among others, spam many of them at significant locations and especially griefed areas around spawn.

**Early 2019** - Sign chunkbans were used around nether 0 0, along with the slogan "spawn's closed". This was patched by Spigot shortly after.

**Nov 2019** - [The Book Club](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Book_Club) used **banner** and **7-layer** chunkbans throughout nether spawn to wreak havoc on queue times and new players. Use was discontinued after [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) patched illegals and NoServerNovember was over.

**April 2020** - [The Bakery](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Bakery) used **furnace** and **e-chest** chunkbans at key locations in the overworld to reduce queue. These had almost the same level of effectiveness as the much more compact patched designs.
* 7th - 12th, Chunkbanning the comet at [Ziggy town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ziggy_Town) with a **furnace** chunkban.
* 17th - 20th, Chunkbanning 0, 0 with **e-chests** causing an amount of spawnfags and yesterfags to get banned.

**April 20th 2020** - Hausemaster patches chunkbans through a rework of chunk loading.

**October 2020** - [rockeZZergon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/rockeZZergon) creates a machine utilizing enchanting tables that, once turned on, cannot be approached to turn it off. Several accounts are priobanned in efforts to take a schematic of the device.

**September 2021** - [Armorsmith's Followers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith%27s_Followers) build "Black Holes" through Operation Black Hole. These are lag machines made with at least 100,000 sand blocks that fall through cobwebs and cause the TPS to drop to 0. These lag machines create chunkbans which prevent any player to escape those chunks, and causes them to freeze and not take any damage. Eventually it would crash 2b2t and wipe the priority queue of any player who loaded the black hole's chunks.

## History
Hurtlockerbeck joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) on October 22, 2019. He joined the [Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperials) shortly thereafter and participated with them until February 2020. While in Imperials, he befriended [diamondranger987](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/diamondranger987), and built at several bases, including Karthwasten Recruit Base, Novigrad, and the Imperial City. After drama surrounding [MrCK10](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MrCK10) in early 2020, he left Imperials and began building at [the Homeland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen#The_Homeland). While there, he was recruited into the [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen) by [Yarnamite](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Yarnamite) and [IronException](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IronException) following a purge in the public Guardsmen Discord. He was initiated a month later with [Takeoutmenu](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Takeoutmenu). Shortly thereafter, he also joined [KOS Assassins](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KOS_Assassins), which introduced him to [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) and resulted in him joining the [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate) and participating in the [10th Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/10th_Incursion). After building at [Adamantium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Adamantium), he was banned from the Guardsmen as a result of drama surrounding false allegations of him causing the grief of [Azure](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen#Azure), as well as drama with [orsond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/orsond). He participated in a number of Guardsmen bases after being unbanned, but increasingly spent time with the Shortbus Caliphate members there, and later joined the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) with them upon its foundation. He became a full member of the Astral Brotherhood in August 2022 after building with the group on and off for a year at such bases as [Vega](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Formative_bases), [Hurtbase](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Early_2022_Expansion), [Helheim](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#April_2022_Expansion), [Helheim 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Helheim_2), [Solaris](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Solaris), and [Dubrovnik](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dubrovnik).

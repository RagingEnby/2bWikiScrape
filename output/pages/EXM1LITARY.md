**EXM1LITARY** is a 2022 player and was a co-founder of the [Cakemasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cakemasons) until his removal from the group.

## Early History
EXM1LITARY joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) on June 21st, 2022. He quickly joined the [DonFuer Spawn Rangers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer#Spawn_Rangers), and was invited to SpawnFuer 25. He became friends with [Kizzycocoa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kizzycocoa) and [xsupergo08](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xsupergo08) over the course of his time at SpawnFuer 25-26. He participated in multiple other bases with DonFuer over the course of Summer and Fall 2022, including Kizzyland and the Cakefuer bases. He was removed from Donfuer soon after, being suspected of leaking their bases.

After Kizzycocoa also got ejected from Donfuer, he and EXM1LITARY co-founded the [Cakemasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cakemasons). EXM1LITARY built at the first Cakemasons base, Strawberry Shortcake. He leaked Strawberry Shortcake and Rice Cake to [Orsond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Orsond) in late October in exchange for access to [Copenheimer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column#Copenheimer). Orsond griefed both bases a week later. He was removed as a member in early January 2023, after [Alfie05](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Alfie05) revealed the previously mentioned exchange.

## January 2023 - October 2023
In January Of 2023, he Would Rejoin Donfuer and Make 2 Small Bases named Exfuer 1 and 2. He had rejoined Donfuer with the sole intention of leaking their bases to [Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys), even leaking his own bases.

In March of 2023, he would become a subcontractor in [The Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column). On the same day, he would be added to the Valley Of Jesus Grief Groupchat. On March 4th, 2023, Kizzycocoa would ban EXM1L from the Cakemasons after he admitted that he was planning to leak Moon Cake, shortly after it was griefed. EXM1L would then dedicate his time to [The Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column). He would participate at Sperg Club 2, Building Few Things (Mostly Pixelart) At the base.

In Early September 2023, He would be made a member of [The Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column)

## Insiding The Fifth Column
EXM1L was convinced by a friend and [Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys) member [Nettastini](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nettastini) to inside The Fifth Column, 5C at the time had a base called [Beneath](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Beneath) that EXM1l was a member of, at this base he accidentally loaded [jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jacktherippa)'s pearl leading to a small crisis in the group.

After Beneath was griefed by BSB and EXM1L on a provided proxy, another base [Above](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Above) was made and leaked promptly to the Backstreet Boys who were instructed to sit on it for a while, after 3 days the base was griefed by BSB and some other people.

He was found out shortly there after ending the insiding spree but not before leaking every server message and copy of Copenheimer.

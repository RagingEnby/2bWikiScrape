## History
### Early History
Dectonic joined 2b2t in late 2016. He joined [Visionary](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Visionary) soon after starting on 2b2t, then left after [1bitjay](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/1bitjay) took over. He then insided [BSB](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BSB) for [Highland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highland), finally joining [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium) in 2019. While in Emperium, he befriended [ufocrossing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ufocrossing). This led directly to the foundation of the [Respect Club](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Respect_Club). He also assisted in providing region world downloads to the Archive server. He became involved in the [original Obsidian roof](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Obsidian_roof#The_circle) project in late 2019 and early 2020.

### Spawnmasons
Dectonic was one of the main players associated with the Spawnmasons that was given coordinates derived from [Nocom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nocom) to check their  respective values in terms of the re-appropriation of building materials for the group. To assist his efforts (which included well over 500 different sets of coordinates), he founded [Team Cat](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Cat). He also created the myth of the Dectonic exploit in order to throw players off the trail from discovering Nocom. This was used as the explanation for many bases and stashes, most notably [Avalonia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Avalonia). Throughout his travels, he collected tamed mobs, numbering over 500 throughout the map at various locations and stashes. As a result of all these activities, as well with his friendships with various members, he became a Spawnmason in May 2021.
Upon its leak, he was also invited to help grief [Block Game Jerusalem](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Jerusalem).

The **World Border** is a semi-transparent wall that surrounds the Minecraft world. The border is 30 million blocks on all four sides, centered around [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn). It was made so that players could not venture into glitched chunks. Back in the days, if you went 12 million blocks out, you would reach the [Far Lands](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Far_Lands), glitched terrain that would make mountains that reached the skies, and infinitely long caves. Mobs also acted weird there, and if you went even further, you would fall through the terrain, and shading did not seem to work. However these Far Lands were eventually removed, and there is no evidence that they were ever generated on 2b2t.

## History of the World Border on 2b2t
### Overworld
 rescuing [Redstoner](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Redstoner2b2t) from a portal trap inside the border (2017)]]
The history of the World Border is shrouded in mystery, as it was reached first sometime in 2011 through a backdoor. This is known due to the findings of chunks from 2011 at the [-X Axis Highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/-X_Axis_Highway). This might have been reached through [popbob's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob) or Acid1212's (supposed) backdoor. The modern World Border was first reached by [Pyrobyte](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pyrobyte) and [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan) through their backdoor on December 7th, 2013 on the +X axis. There they left some bedrock and two signs. They also teleported to the -X and -Z world borders but did not leave anything there.

* **+X**: On March 26 2017, the X+ world border was reached by [xxq](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xxq), [rasqi](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/rasqi), [MiningMinecraft](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MiningMinecraft), [househousehouse1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/househousehouse1), and [Auion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Auion). The final stretch of digging was streamed on twitch by xxq and later uploaded to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8aTSyHThT8). The base [Point Nemo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Point_Nemo) was founded at the world border and lasted less than a week. Point Nemo was griefed by [Babbaj](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Babbaj). After Point Nemo's grief, the X+ world border area was turned into "new spawn" by [Nordic93](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nordic93), who made a giant lavacast wall, similar to his well known ones at spawn. This was the first world border in Minecraft history to be reached by digging.
* After this event, many other groups such as the [+Z Diggers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/%2BZ_Digging_Group) and [-X Diggers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/-X_Diggers) where formed to finish the Highways to the other borders.
* **-X**: The -X Diggers reached the border on December 22nd, 2017. They made a giant Christmas tree as they arrived two days before Christmas, and later exchanged gifts with each other.
* **+Z:** The +Z Diggers reach the border on June 9th, 2017. This was the only overworld border that had not been teleported too.
* **-Z:** The -Z border was the only one to be reached by flying first before digging. The player [gRiNdLoRd](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/gRiNdLoRd) flew under the Nether floor to the border for 10 hours, reaching it on August 7th, 2017. The highway itself was later completed by the group [Highland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highland).

### End
Owing to its remoteness and difficulty to reach, few players have traveled to any end borders, with the vast majority arriving as a result of [Harrissssonn's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Harrissssonn) journey there in 2022 and rampant use of [BoatTp.
### -,- End Corner
.](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Travel#BoatTP)The End World Border was first reached by [Armorsmith](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith) when he took a week to fly using packetfly, lagging the server during the journey. When he arrived, he created a base called [Armorland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Small_Bases#Armorland) at the world border corner on August 17th, 2017. The base was located at the coordinates X: -30,000,000 , Z: -30,000,000. [Harrissssonn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Harrissssonn) flew to the (-,-) end corner in early 2022, which he reached on June 12, 2022. Once there he started [Corner Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Corner_Base), and teleported many players there.

### End Border
The End border apart from the (-,-) corner also been reached by players such as [BarrenDome](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BarrenDome) and [Hare_Hare_Yukai](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hare_Hare_Yukai), although it's been much less traveled to than the corner.

### Nether
In April 2018 [ThebesAndSound](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ThebesAndSound) became the first player to reach the Nether World Border, travelling by a boat phase exploit to the +,+ corner.

In March 2020, [0x22](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0x22), [IronException](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IronException), and [l_amp](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/l_amp) visited all main axis and corner world borders in the Nether, using a teleportation exploit. The Nether world border was first reached via mining on the +X Highway by the [Motorway Extension Gurus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Motorway_Extension_Gurus) on May 12, 2021. Previous signs by IronException and l_amp were present at the border upon arrival. The 0z Way to the +X was completed by the +X Nether Border Diggers on June 22, 2021.

# _Courier6_

**_Courier6_** is an explorer who joined 2b2t in 2016.

## History
### Early History
_Courier6_ joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) after repeatedly seeing [TheCampingRusher's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) 'OLDEST ANARCHY SERVER' video on his recommendations and decided to watch it. The age and the sheer size of the server's map piqued Courier's interest enough that it caused him to join out of curiosity. When he joined, he noticed he had [veteran queue](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Veteran_Queue) and items in his inventory before joining due to Rusher's video, meaning he had also joined at some point before June 1st 2016. On his first day, he walked to the [Valley of Wheat](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valley_of_Wheat) and built a house there, which was destroyed the next day.

#### Time in DonFuer
During summer 2017 _Courier6_ Joined the new group [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer). He was a part of multiple bases. Helping the group with the crafting book dupe. He was a member of the original [Don Hoggal](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Don_Hoggal) base, until its destruction. He was kicked out of DonFuer for publishing a video of the base on YouTube, after it was leaked, but before it was actually greifed. This was a decision [D_loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_loaded) would later admit was probably too harsh.

### The Museum
In 2017, _Courier6_ came across [The Museum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Museum) after listening to [FitMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FitMC) mentioning it and [Project Vault](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Project_Vault) on his livestreams, although he had no idea of the drama between the two until much later on. Because of his interest in 2b2t history, Courier visited the Museum server frequently oftentimes then traveled to the locations on 2b2t itself. This kick-started his so-called 'nomad lifestyle' on the server. Since around a majority of the bases on the Museum weren't yet griefed, Courier spent much of 2017 visiting the coords of each base and collecting items from them, which he stored in his ender chest. _Courier6_ soon became friends with [Beardler](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Beardler) and [Tomah54660](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tomah54660) (aka jddinger) and became a moderator of the Museum server because of Beardler until the [BoeMeccan Witch Trials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BoeMeccan_Witch_Trials) took place in May 2018.

### Base-Hunting
After the death of The Museum, Courier went on a hiatus until early-2019. When he came back, he decided to base-hunt far out on his own. This decision was helped by [Elytra](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Elytra) being re-enabled in August 2019. He exclusively hunted for old bases in old chunk trails for the nostalgia of the old versions of Minecraft. He started collecting many unique items like snowballs with no textures (that were given to him by [fr1kin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fr1kin)) and alpha leaves.

Back in 2017, he came up with the idea that if a player went in a circle around spawn, one could find every chunk trail and mark down where it was. Because of a new elytra exploit in 2019, he and his friend [4pilot](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/4pilot) went in a circle 135k blocks from spawn in the nether (or about 1.08 M blocks in the Overworld) and found 150 different chunk trails. The reason they went so far out was because there were so many chunks in the nether generated before 1M blocks in the Overworld that it would be hard to find a chunk trail. Using this method, Courier and 4Pilot found bases from as far back as 2014.

In 2018, _Courier6_ found water on the nether roof and planned to build an airship on the roof so he could flood Nether spawn with water once the server updated to 1.13. When Courier came back to the water on August 8th, 2019, he found that [Lordkai1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lordkai1) had broken a hole in the nether roof and made a base out of the nether water called [Wässrige Hölle](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Wassrige_Holle). Courier, [Gsmack](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Gsmack), and 4Pilot griefed the base shortly after. Aside from Wässrige Hölle, _Courier6_ found many locations above the nether roof including an entire forest with a base at 1 million blocks from spawn and a base with a train station.

In October 2019, one of his base-hunting friends, [123Fly123](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/123Fly123) found a sign left by Hausemaster in a base he found. _Courier6_ and 4pilot asked for coordinates but he didn't respond. They knew it was in the (-, -) quadrant as he had previously talked about base-hunting in that quadrant. After 2 weeks of searching chunk trails, they found the base and discovered that several parts of the base were very obviously world-edited out as only some blocks from the base were removed. After they logged out, they both died back to spawn, and the rest of the base was removed with WorldEdit.

By February 28th, 2020, Courier had collected about 15 shulkers of unique items and books and kept them in an ender chest. However, [Nerds Inc](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc) started using the [Authentication Exploit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Authentication_Exploit) to log into players' accounts without the use of a password. [Babbaj](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Babbaj) used the exploit on _Courier6_ and burnt all his shulkers.

### Present Day
_Courier6_ played increasingly less throughout 2021 and 2022, initially as a result of the AuthExploit, and later because he was prio-banned by [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster). He was given a friend's alternate account in 2022, which was prio-banned after less than a week.

## Trivia
*_Courier6_ is sometimes called the "king" or "nomad king" of 2b2t, possibly because [FitMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FitMC) once called him the 'Nether Water Defender', the members of the [Mongoloid Khanate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mongoloid_Khanate) often jokingly call him the 'King of 2b2t'

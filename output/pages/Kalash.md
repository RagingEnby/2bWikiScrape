**Kalash**, known as **Reima** on YouTube, was a member of [2fort2furious](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2fort2furious) (2f2f), the founder of the *Team Fortress 2* clan [The Axeassins](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Axeassins), and an administrator of the [2b2t *Garry's Mod* server](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_(Garry%27s_Mod_server)). He met [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) on 2f2f in 2008, and invited him to The Axeassins.

## History
Kalash created his Steam account on December 14, 2005.

Kalash founded The Axeassins, a *Team Fortress 2* clan, on November 3, 2008. Kalash later met Hausemaster on 2f2f and invited him to The Axeassins.

Kalash was later banned from 2f2f for him and his group being notoriously exploitative. After this, in August 2008, Hausemaster created the 2builders2tools (2b2t) Steam group and *Garry's Mod* server, a parody of 2fort2furious. Kalash was an administrator and helped maintain the server with Hausemaster. However, in April 2009, he got demoted along with 11 other admins, making Hausemaster the only admin. It is unknown why this happened.

Following the demotions, the Steam group was raided. The *Garry's Mod* server went down sometime before [2b2t's *Minecraft* server](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) started in December 2010, as stated by Kalash, but it is unknown when exactly this happened.

Kalash did not play on the 2b2t *Minecraft* server.

His clan, The Axeassins, continued for years. The Steam group has always been locked as invite-only. It still exists with 140 members as of September 2020.

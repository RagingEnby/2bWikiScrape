**Travel** is an important part of every 2b2t player's play style. Whether moving near or far all 2b2t players travel.

## Methods of Travel
There are several methods of travel used by players on 2b2t. Some of them being exploits and others being natural Minecraft methods.

### Importance of Highways
The main way of travel is to use speed hacks on the main [highways](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highways). Many players tend to use the Nether highways rather than their [overworld](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Overworld) counterparts, as traveling one block in the Nether is the equivalent of traveling 8 blocks in the overworld. All highways (axis and diagonal) have been dug the overworld border which is 3.75m blocks in the Nether.

### Animals
Players on 2b2t often use animals to travel. Travel using horses and pigs were the dominant form of movement across large distances using an exploit called Entity Speed, which allowed players to travel extremely fast on animals. Entity Speed was patched in 2019, after [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) made a reddit post announcing the upcoming patch. Entities were unable to go through portals in 2020, but this was reverted along with an entity speed nerf.

### Boats
Boats historically have been used often, especially when escaping spawn for the first time, as you could travel tens or even hundreds of thousands of blocks thanks to 2b2t's enormous oceans and [the Southern Canal](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Southern_Canal). However, a player riding a boat is often kicked off as a result of 2b2t's low [TPS](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TPS). This makes boats difficult to use as a method of transportation, and they are rarely used now.

#### Boatfly
The aptly-named 'Boatfly' is also a method sometimes used. Although often patched, it was popular for various periods in 2015, 2018, late 2020, and early 2022. [Durkaaqt's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Durkaaqt) varient in 2022 was unique in that it used an 'h-clip' (horizontal clip) module to move.

#### Boatphase
Boatphase, is an exploit that was discovered in 2018 which allows players to travel at very high speeds. [jordanl666](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jordanl666) used this exploit in 2018, in hopes of reaching the nether world border, but he only made it to +X 20 million.

#### BoatTP
BoatTP was an exploit that utilized boats and end gateways to teleport players in [The End](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_End). It was discovered by a [Harrisssonn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Harrisssonn) in early 2022. It was independently discovered by several Russian players several months later. To work, a player simply went to an end gateway, and piloted a boat into it. The boat would then appear at end spawn for a fraction of a second, during which time the player being teleported would enter the boat and be transported back to the starting location of the teleporting player. Some players used Automount to enter the boat although it was not necessary. It was extensively utilized by Harrissssonn on his journey to the -,- End world border Corner, and the subsequent [Corner Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Corner_Base) there. The exploit was patched after going public in mid 2022, with individuals such as Harrissssonn and [orsond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/orsond) directly emailing server admins about the exploit.

### Elytra
[Elytras](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Elytra) are a popular method of travel for getting around on 2b2t. Players use elytra in combination with fireworks to glide along nether highways. Many hacked clients include the mod "ElytraFly" which allows players to use an Elytra without ever falling down or having to boost themselves up using rockets (sometimes it also allows elytras to maintain their durability). It was thanks to this module that certain milestones were achieved, such as [Armorsmith](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith)'s successful journey to the [End](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_End)'s World Border Corner. The Elytra is an essential item for fast traveling in the End. ElytraFly is also automated by many clients, allowing for a player to AFK as they fly down the highway to make AFK travel possible with the help of the Baritone bot. This process can be somewhat tedious, given 2b2t's low TPS. However, due to the incredibly fast pace of ElytraFly, many players now use it to travel on 2b2t. But unfortunately, ElytraFly Hacks were patched in September 2020 making fast travel much harder. This also affected vanilla flight, making it buggy and risky to use. Finally, a workaround for ElytraFly Hacks (using elytra-packet settings) was found near the end of 2020. It was eventually patched in the beginning of 2021 by [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster). In late 2021, a new ElytraFly hack was discovered, and distributed throughout 2b2t, and is the most common method of travel on 2b2t as of Fall of 2022.

### Airships
[Airships](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Airships) have been intermittently used to fly around, though not commonly. When airships are used, it is usually in [the End](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_End). These machines could be [militarized](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bombers) (until the patch of infinite TNT) or used for different tasks.

### Bed Travel
BedTP was discovered by [C4RTM4N](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/C4RTM4N) and [taylo112](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/taylo112). The original form method involved setting up a nether portal next to the bed, waiting until nighttime, and then going in the portal. Before teleporting to the Nether, the player then slept in their strategically-located bed, and automatically exited the bed in the Nether, but at the coordinates of the bed's location in [the Overworld](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Overworld). It was used in the grief of [The Lands](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Lands) by [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) and taylo112. The exploit was subsequently patched.

With the release of the Bed Godmode exploit, (which allowed a player to leave their beds while still communicating bed occupancy to the server), BedTP became unpatched. The player could then go through Nether portals to teleport to the nearest bed (which could be millions of blocks out). This exploit was also discovered [C4RTM4N](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/C4RTM4N) in mid-to-late 2016,and was patched in early-to-mid 2017. This version was used to bring [TheCampingRusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) to The Lands.. The discovery of an exposed bedchain to  C4RTM4N's base, [La Rosa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/La_Rosa), led to its grief by [Invictus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Invictus) in late 2016.

### Baritone
A program called [Baritone](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Baritone) is complete with real-time pathfinding capabilities, which allows players to type in coordinates and AFK as Baritone walks to their destination. Baritone can parkour, mine blocks, and perform other cool tricks; however, it is not 100% safe as the laggy conditions on 2b2t can leave it struggling to make its next move. Baritone is integrated into several clients, the most notable being [Impact](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hacked_Clients).

Many clients now also integrate automated Elytra Flight, which is even quicker than walking.

### Ender Pearl Loading
Ender Pearl Loading is arguably the fastest way to travel on 2b2t consistently. By suspending a pearl in either an unloaded chunk or in a stream of water, you can set a teleport point. At any later date no matter how far away you are, as long as you are in the same dimension- someone can "load" your pearl and teleport you to the location instantly. This method of travel is used to move large stashes across millions of blocks, prevent excessive nether trails and activity to bases, and allow players to visit spawn and other bases without needing to travel millions back to bases.

### Tridents
Following the server's update to 1.19 in 2023. Tridents became usable for the first time. The most common travel exploits involving tridents are, TridentSpeed and Exploited Riptide. From 2023-2024 the combination of the two allowed players to travel at speeds unimagineable in all three dimensions without an elytra. Upon the server's update to its anticheat plugin "Grim", the trident exploits were patched.

### TNT Cannons
While this method of travel is uncommonly used on 2b2t.org, TNT Cannons can be a very fast way to travel, if the player has armor strong enough to survive the explosions. Cannons can be cause a large amount of [lag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lag_machine) while in use which, when combined with the low [TPS](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TPS) on 2b2t, can make cannons significantly slower than other methods of travel. One notable user of TNT cannons on 2b2t is [IHasToes](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IHasToes).

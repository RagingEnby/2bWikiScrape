# Dawnfall_

**Dawnfall_** is a builder who is and has been affiliated with a wide variety of groups. He is the leader of [t gang](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/t_gang), a member of [Bookhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bookhood), and was a builder at the [Rat House](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rat_House).

## History
### Early History
Dawnfall_ discovered [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) through [Barrendome's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Barrendome) 2019 [Flower Trail](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Flower_Trail) video and became interested in the server. He joined the server later in 2020 after COVID-19 quarantine started along with several friends. While they quickly lost interest and left, Dawnfall_ remained.
One of Dawnfall_'s friends helped him establish his first base, Waterchunk Island, which served as a gathering place for new acquaintances he met on the server, such as [CamiiMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CamiiMC). As more people were invited to the base, a cohesive group emerged. Dawnfall_ initially named the group 't', later renaming the group [t gang](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/t_gang), by which name it is still called. In late 2020, Dawnfall_ met the leaders of the Lost Nomads, including [__Omni](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/__Omni), [TimTheEnchanter](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TimTheEnchanter), and [SilverEyes2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SilverEyes2b2t). Over time, Dawnfall_ and SilverEyes2b2t become close friends, leading them to collaborate on Camp Lighthouse, and several [Nomad Games](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nomad_Games) events.

In late 2020, t gang as a whole decided to relocate to a more secure location for [duping](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dupes) with the Pyro Dupe, making a stash, and ultimately starting a base. The most trusted members ventured farther out to establish the new base, which became Dawnfall_'s main base for most of the following year.

### Wider Community Involvement
After the Pyro Dupe was patched, many of the t gang members became inactive, prompting Dawnfall_ to engage more actively with the broader community. [Franknificant](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Franknificant), another builder then associated with the Nomad Games, invited Dawnfall_ and other t gang members to join [Infinity Incursion's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinity_Incursion) building division. There, Dawnfall_ became acquainted with numerous II members, such as [BachiBachBach](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BachiBachBach), [Kekheart](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kekheart), and [Nameoner](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nameoner). Building a reputation for trustworthiness, Dawnfall_ began receiving invitations to contribute as a guest builder at various bases, such as with the [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen) at [The Crypt](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen#Leadership_Troubles) and the [Invincibles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Invincibles) at [Wild Emerald](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Invincibles). Through his association with the Guardsmen, he was also invited to the [Rat House](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rat_House).

### Mapopoly
In mid-2021, [oofplux](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/oofplux), a high-ranking member of t gang, visited [Block Game Mecca](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Mecca) for a server tour and stumbled upon a large carpet stash left in the base's so-called 'Industrial District' by its builders. Unsure of what to do with the carpet, oofplux reached out to Dawnfall_. With his experience in creating map arts, Dawnfall_ proposed the idea of constructing an 11x11 carpet monopoly board. The carpet was relocated to a building site, which was originally intended to be placed near a t gang base. However, due to a leak of the base, the carpet was moved once again to a new location, where construction began. The project became t gang's main focus on 2b2t for approximately eight months until its completion in early 2022. It was griefed shortly thereafter, firstly by Dawnfall after being warned by oofplux that Moonshine was coming to grief, and then by [Moonshine](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Moonshine) itself after an alleged disagreement between the [Eclipse](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Eclipse), which oofplux and Dawnfall_ were a part of, and Moonshine. Following this, Dawnfall_ received an invitation to join an [SBA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SBA) spawn base, followed by a period of inactivity for a few months.

### Further Community Involvement
Upon returning, Dawnfall_ reconnected with old acquaintances who were formally in II and Guardsmen, but were now in [Bookhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bookhood), [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood), and [Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column) following the disbandment of those groups and the migration of their former members. Many former t gang members also returned to the server. Dawnfall participated in various bases, such as [2b2t Oscars 2022 Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Oscars_2022_Base), [Solaris](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Solaris), [The Spike](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Spike), and other bases, respectively. Dawnfall_ brought many of the t gang members to base at Solaris, [Polaris](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#-aris_bases), and [Molaris](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#-aris_bases) with the Astral Brotherhood as well, before being granted full membership in Bookhood. He later built at the [Spawnquarium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnquarium).

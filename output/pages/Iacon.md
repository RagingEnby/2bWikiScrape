}}**Iacon** was a base founded by [SLAGATHOR09](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SLAGATHOR09) in late 2011. Residents included players such as [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2).
## History
Iacon was originally founded in late 2011 by [SLAGATHOR09](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SLAGATHOR09).
He built there with close friends of his. In 2011, SLAGATHOR09 met [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2) at [xcc2's Swamp Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2%27s_Swamp_Base), which was only 4k away from Iacon. xcc2 arrived and built there with with the others. The base consisted of a large walled-in area with a mob grinder, ziggurat, and various other buildings.  Later xcc2 left the base to return to his swamp base and [SquidBase](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SquidBase). Xcc2 returned in late 2012 to take a WDL of the base, SLAGATHOR09 and friends quit after it was griefed.
xcc2 returned to Iacon in 2017 and rebuilt it with [catcusman77](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/catcusman77).

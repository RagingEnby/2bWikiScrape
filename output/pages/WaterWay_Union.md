}}**The WaterWay Union** is an infrastructure group on 2b2t with the goal of expanding and maintaining the [Southern Canal](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Southern_Canal), the longest single canal in Minecraft's History.

## History
Started in January 2023, the WaterWay Union was started in the aftermath of the fall of the [Southern Canal Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Southern_Canal_Association). Once the group fractured, many of its members sought out a new place to go, so they could continue their work on the canal.

[Godroster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Godroster) and [ThebesAndSound](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ThebesAndSound) came together with other former leaders and active members of SCA, and created a new Southern Canal group. This group at first had no proper name, but after some time, a vote was held with names offered by members of the group, and the WaterWay Union was chosen as the official name. The same was done for the Banner Design of the group, as well as many of the monikers that the group holds for those that work on the Canal.

After the events of the SCA conflict with the [Southern Highway Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Southern_Highway_Association), the WWU continued to not only remove the obsidian pavement from the canal, but also worked to expand it to the current size of 32 blocks wide. There were still moments where griefers would show up on the canal to pave some of the canal, but these small events did not faze the players who work on the canal. ThebesandSound worked to design measures to protect the new canal from griefers, including water spouts along the canal, and bridges made of obsidian to prevent bot accounts from paving the canal. These were found to have success in preventing griefing, but the conflict persisted in areas that did not have these measures taken. There were many instances of the group members being attacked on the canal, and being spawn camped by PvP'ers and those who wished to stop their work. Despite this, their work persevered. They continued to work to expand the canal, and they outlasted their griefers, who would after several months leave the Southern Canal to do other things.

The work on the Southern Canal after this continued at a greater pace as there were no distractions to the work being performed. Members pushed forward to continue to expand the canal to the new width with various protective measures and also software designed by ThebesandSound, IronException, w00tles, and PoTheMagicDragon. Throughout 2023 and 2024 the group removed millions of blocks of obsidian from the canal which had been used to grief it; they completed this lengthy project in November 2024.

In March 2025, the group celebrated reaching 1 Million blocks on the canal, officially achieving the goal they had of pushing the Southern Canal to 1 Million OW.

They continue work on the Canal to this day.

## Events
### 6 Month Anniversary
At the 6 month anniversary of the WaterWay Union, a prominent member of the group, [Max1mumChr1s](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Max1mumChr1s), worked with [Godroster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Godroster) to invite some of the most trusted members of the group to the base [Don Maximus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Don_Maximus). At this base, Max1mumChr1s built a full scale replica of the New Southern Canal, along with water spouts and obsidian bridges, which are used on the canal to save it from griefers. Many of the group's most trusted members were invited to the base, including [FIRECATINBLACK](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FIRECATINBLACK), [IronException](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IronException), [W00tles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/W00tles), [PoTheMagicDragon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/PoTheMagicDragon), [NIGHTRUNNER_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NIGHTRUNNER_), [_xque](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_xque), and [injoytoday2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/injoytoday2). They all built at the base, and added their own touch to the area that had been laid out for them by the canal.

This base can be visited on [The Archive (server)](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Archive_(server))

### 550k Milestone
The first official milestone built by the WaterWay Union, the 550k Milestone, was constructed by Max1mumChr1s and [Phosph0lipid](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Phosph0lipid). It was built in a futuristic style.  The milestone was a celebration of all the work that the group had done to expand and protect the canal.

This milestone was griefed by [Ko8efanboy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ko8efanboy) and [xsupergo08](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xsupergo08).

### Rat Race
To break up the monotony of working on the canal, in July of 2023 the WWU hosted a 15 day long canal building competition with 3 different events;  most obsidian mined, most obsidian placed, and most stone mined. Prizes were awarded to the winners of each category and were sponsored by WWU leadership and Max1mumChr1s.

The winners of each category are as follows:

* Mining Obsidian: [injoytoday2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/injoytoday2) with 191,131 obsidian mined
* Placing Obsidian: [IronException](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IronException) with 913,680 obsidian placed
* Mining Stone: [ZockSB](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ZockSB) with 3,450,200 stone mined

## Bases
The most prominent bases that the WaterWay Union has are the "Cookie Shacks" that are constructed by Godroster. These are the place where Godroster constructs the farms he uses for his "Cookie Runs" that he typically streams on Twitch. Many trusted members are invited to these bases since they allow for ease of access to the canal and a place to rest and reset.

There are many small builds and bases along the canal that are built by members of the group. These rest stops allow for travelers to take a break, relax, and then go on their way. They typically have a cache of building materials, and sometimes members of the WWU will leave gifts for travelers in chests to be found. The most notable structures, the cookie booths near spawn, are built and maintained by Godroster. New players can often find food (usually cookies), boats, or other starting materials at the chests placed in rest stops.

The remains of griefed rest stops can frequently be seen along the edge of the canal.

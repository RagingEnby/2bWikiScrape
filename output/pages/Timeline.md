## Pre–*Minecraft* server
{{See also|Hausemaster#Early history| 2b2t#Origin|2fort2furious|2b2t (Garry's Mod server)}}

This time concerns all relevant events that lead up to 2b2t's creation as a *Minecraft* server.

***November 7, 2005** – [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) creates his Steam account.
***February 2008 – 2009** – [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) is active on the *Team Fortress 2* server 2fort2furious (2f2f). He also creates an account on the 2f2f forum on February 20, 2008.
*[Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) meets Kalash (Reima) on 2f2f, who invites him to a *Team Fortress 2* group called the "Axeassins".
***August 29, 2008 –** [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) starts the 2b2t Steam group with the aim to host game servers, titled "2builders2tools (2b2t)", a parody of 2f2f**.**
***August 2008 –** between April 2009 and December 2010 – [2b2t's *Garry's Mod* server](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_(Garry%27s_Mod_server)) begins after Kalash is banned from 2f2f for exploits. After creating the *Minecraft* server, the group is still active and continues hosting servers, although none are as significant as the *Garry's Mod* and *Minecraft* servers. The group was deleted by Hause in 2019 or 2020.
***August 3, 2010** – *Minecraft* survival multiplayer is released.

## 2010
**Player Count: 50–70** (Accounts vary){{Citation needed}}
It is unclear when 2b2t exactly started, although it is widely accepted that it happened in December 2010. On a Facepunch forum 'Housemaster' claimed on April 28th 2011 he and his friend has been hosting the server 'for seven months now', implying the server was started around September 2010. The player [pYrO1v1aniac](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/pYrO1v1aniac) claimed the server started on Alpha 1.7, but this version never existed. although it is possible that 2b2t has been created in version Alpha 1.1.0
* 2b2t is started and populated by people already active in the existing 2b2t *[Garry's Mod](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Garry%27s_Mod)* community (such as Rage639 and BennyGun).
* [The Mentlegen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Mentlegen) is established, 2b2t's first known faction.{{Citation needed}}
* Spawn is damaged, mostly by creeper explosions.

## 2011
2011 is the year the server truly started its history. After running for a few months the world-map was completely reset in February. The server experienced what Sato86 would call the ‘Age of Unrest’: a phase of high activity. During this time there were between 50 and 80 players, a tight-knit community that was even in contact with the admin. During 2011 the server would update through all the ‘beta’ editions of Minecraft that belonged to the final stage of Minecraft’s development. The server would experience the additions of new features such as The Nether in May and enchantments and potions in November. The size of the server map grew up to 70 gigabytes. The spawn area was nothing more than an obsidian plateau where new players would regularly be trapped in lava.

During 2011 many iconic bases were established, such as NFE, Old Town and the Valley of Wheat. 2b2t would also witness its first faction-based conflicts. In April the presence of Facepunchers would trigger attacks from players from 4chan, initiating what is known as the Facepunch War. Since 2b2t was an anarchy server, players were also free to exploit the game’s mechanics. In July this led to the development of the first duplication glitch: the Piston Dupe. Due to the growing map and exploits, the server had a hard time keeping up with the developing map and community. In July, it temporarily went offline to acquire new hardware and in August it even experienced severe data corruption. At the end of the year the player popbob managed to backdoor the server, allowing him to terrorize other players, obtain large amounts of wealth and leave marks that would only be found years later.

## 2012
In many ways 2012 was very similar to the previous year. In the aftermath of the Facepunch War the community remained very tight-knit and connected to the admin. Sato86 dubbed the time between early 2012 and April 2013 the ‘Great Decay’, although this might be a bit of an exaggeration since the community was still active and developing. Players developed their own hacked clients, discovered new exploits such as the Gravity Dupe and used remnants of the First Backdoor to illegally generate The End dimension in March 2012. Meanwhile, iconic bases such as Imperator’s Base and The Lands were established. The server kept updating, gaining new features such as books and maps, which were freely used and exploited by the player base.

## 2013
2013 would become a very eventful year. Sato86 spoke of the ‘Age of Resurgence’, a period ranging from April 2013 and August 2015, during which the server experienced a revival of activity. At the start it seemed like the server went on as it had been for over two years, with the occasional exploit and base. Around early 2013 the server experienced its first coordinate exploit: The Thunder Hack, which players like popbob used to – again – terrorize the community. The group Valkyria would organize the first ‘public’ events: the 1st Incursion in June and the 2nd Incursion in August, and establish iconic bases such as Valkyria and Asgard. Soon afterward more factions rose, such as the Legion of Shenandoah. 2b2t was also exposed to a wider public when the magazine IGN (Imagine Games Network) mentioned the server in an article about Minecraft. However, later in the year the server would once again see a severe decline in activity and experience its 2nd Backdoor.

**CancerChan** is an infamous insider who became well-known for leaking the coordinates to several bases. He joined the server several days after [TheCampingRusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher). During his travels on the [-X Axis Highway](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/-X_Axis_Highway) in the Nether, he came upon a relatively rich abandoned base, leading to many players misconceiving him to be an older player. The predominant theories were that CancerChan was an alt of either [CytotoxicTcell](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CytotoxicTcell) or [Caleesii](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Caleesii), which lead to rumors that he was in fact a girl.
## History
### Aureus Drama
His most notorious act was the cause of the destruction of [Aureus City](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Aureus_City). He went along with the rumors that he was a girl, with [SnackyNorph](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SnackyNorph) subsequently sending a request for 'proof'. CancerChan sent pictures of his ex-girlfriend. They subsequently began to e-date. SnackyNorph brought CancerChan to [Aureus City](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Aureus_City) against the wishes of the other residents. After deriving the coordinates of Aureus, CancerChan traded them to [taylo112](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/taylo112), [CorruptedUnicorn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CorruptedUnicorn), and [BenitoTortelini](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Alien803) (who later leaked the coordinates publicly). The residents of Aureus subsequently griefed the base. After the drama, CancerChan leaked several bases to TheCampingRusher, which were mostly SnackyNorph's dupe stashes.

### Team Aurora
During the waning days of the [Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rusher_War), CancerChan found the Team Aurora HQ. He began to build at the base without being a member of the group. [NedaT](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NedaT) noticed, and invited him into the group. CancerChan soon betrayed them, leaking the coordinates of Aurora base in retaliation for [Chloe2K15](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chloe2K15) stealing a stack of enchanted golden apples from him. CancerChan, along with his friend, [Da99thWolf](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Da99thWolf), began to  grief Aurora HQ, causing the members to grief their own base after fighting CancerChan and Da99thWolf off.

In early 2011, Camp Facepunch served as one of the inaugural installations of the [Facepunch Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Facepunch_Republic), marking its place as one of the pioneering Facepunch Bases.

## History
Constructed to accommodate the recently arrived Facepunch residents, it was established sometime in late April 2011, potentially as late as April 27, 2011. On April 28, during the infamous "Greyskull's Stand" event, the base fell victim to an attack and extensive vandalism perpetrated by mweorz, who utilized a hacked client. Mweorz was, in fact, the alternate account of [Luke2thebun](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Luke2thebun), a 4channer who had successfully infiltrated the Republic's ranks. This devastating assault would go down in history as the pivotal moment that ignited the Facepunch War.

At present, it rests ensconced within a full-fledged [lavacast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/lavacast), perched atop a section of the wither cave that has been entirely inundated with water, leaving it vulnerable to the possibility of complete submersion.

## Geography
It was unknowingly going to be located on the [42 Z-Axis Road](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/42_Z-Axis_Road) (Which itself was created by [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2)) after xcc2 made a spawn road tunneling through it. The base was also located at {{Coords|500|42}}.
## Architecture
It was made using 8 towers of cobblestone connected by walls. In 2012, it was restored by DeadDreamer.

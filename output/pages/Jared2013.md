[incursions](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Incursions) and co-founding [Nerds Inc](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc).

## History
### Beginnings
Jared2013 joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) in February 2013. He was active on a different anarchy server with factions plugins called LoneMiners, where his sole purpose was to grief every single base he came across. After it shut down due to a lack of 4chan posts and activity, his friend Dr_Cash convinced him to join 2b2t. Dr_Cash gave Jared access to the account jared2013, which was allegedly a random account he had gained access to. He played on 2b2t on the jared2013 account occasionally up until August 2013, when Jared was killed by [thePOMPANO](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/thePOMPANO) and [Coldwave](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coldwave) at spawn, players involved with the [Second Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/II_Incursion). Shortly after, he met [Pyrobyte](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pyrobyte), who gave him armor and tools. He would later become friends with Pyrobyte, who would later introduce him to [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan). Sometime in late 2013, [exaltedspartan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/exaltedspartan) let Jared into his base where he built a "hideous statue of Satan." Jared at this time appreciated 2b2t for its relatively small closely knit community and the freedom it provided compared to other servers.

#### Griefing
Similarly to LoneMiners, Jared also made it his sole purpose to grief every base he came across. He would also bring notoriety to his name by constantly typing in chat that he would grief [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria). Jared used numerous and often stolen accounts to establish himself using different 'personas', which he respectively used for building, griefing, and even doxxing. He mostly used the jared2013 account for griefing and other accounts for insiding, although jared2013 became his 'main' account after his other accounts were shut down by Mojang for being stolen. He always used TNT during his griefs and never with withers or [lavacasts](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/lavacasts). He described his feeling of being caught in the act of griefing as difficult to describe, although he would rather see the owner of the base logging in after the grief rather than during it. During his griefing career, he also became friends with the people of bases he griefed including [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2) and [0xymoron](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0xymoron). Around June of 2014, he was part of a 17-player crew who griefed [OreMonger](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/OreMonger)'s base.

### The Tyranny and Major Griefs
#### Wrath Outpost
During the [Third Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Third_Incursion), jared, along with [fr1kin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fr1kin), [taylo112](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/taylo112), [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob), and [x0xp](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/X0XP) (with iTristan playing both sides) attempted to grief and invade [Wrath Outpost](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Wrath_Outpost). However, they would never succeed because Pyrobyte had a sword with a sharpness level of 666 and TNT with a negative value that would give him an infinite number of TNT. This was the first time that jared had met fr1kin and x0XP and they attempted to "invade" the outpost with an "army of bots", so a trench was made by the incursion to stop them. On an icy lake nearby, he also fought a player named [balonypony](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/balonypony), whom he usually fought with occasionally and was matched at PvP skills with.

#### Activity in 2015
Sometime before 2015, Jared met [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan) and [taylo112](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/taylo112) and befriended them. Together, they gained the location of [Space Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_Valkyria) using the [/tell @a exploit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coordinate_exploit#%2Fmsg_coordinate_exploit) in late May 2015 and subsequently griefed it. Before 2015, jared would grief every base he came across until a player named [Andrew_Gill](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Andrew_Gill) struck up a conversation of jared and he recognized Andrew. He let Jared stay in his base, [Rhodes](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rhodes), before he logged out of the server for the last time. Jared considers this to be one of 2 major bases he considered himself to be a part of.

#### Imperator's Base
{{Main|Imperator's Base}}Later in the year, iTristan sent a screenshot to jared of his house at [Imperator's Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperator%27s_Base) around -1.08M, -1.08M before subsequently deleting it. Jared saved it and didn't think much of it. After a falling out between the 2 in late-2015 for unknown reasons, jared found a base at -40k, -40k, and discovered signs made by [ImperatorTerrae](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ImperatorTerrae). Jared put two and two together and realized that Imperator had walked in a straight line on a diagonal path from Imps Base down to -40k, -40k. By November, jared started preparing to get to Imps Base by going to -1080000 X and grinding on a zombie farm for 20 days straight so he could make numerous enchanted pickaxes. In December that year, Jared started mining around 135000 blocks through a 1 by 2 hole through the nether to get from -1080000, 0 to -1080000, -1080000 in overworld coordinates. When he reached Imps Base, he and [fr1kin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fr1kin) came out of the nether under the Jesus Statue and started griefing the base. They didn't have enough TNT to grief the base, but they found a stash of gunpowder from 2012 from when books could be assigned enchantments on the client side and create 32k looting enchantments. Using the gunpowder and after collecting sand from nearby deserts, they griefed [Imperator's Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperator%27s_Base). During the grief, an argument in chat occurred between jared and popbob which would become known as the 'jared vs popbob' dialogue, of which [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) did a dramatic reading before becoming a youtuber. Afterwards, [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa) and [SilverKrownKing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SilverKrownKing) destroyed many of Jared's stashes and a series of '2b2t diaries' written by Jared in minecraft books were found and leaked. Jared also "doxxed" Tristan by leaking his tzone account and region files, which would later be used as proof of the backdoor's existence.

#### The Tyranny
Jared considers 2016 to be his favorite year in 2b2t history due to the abundance of chaos throughout the year. It started in February 2016, when Jared and taylo112 founded [The Tyranny](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc), later known as 'Nerds Inc.', a group first created for the griefing of [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa)'s [The Lands](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Lands) and later evolved into an attempt to control of the server and would eventually consist of 2b2t's most notorious griefers and exploiters, including Jared, [taylo112](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/taylo112), [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan), [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob), and [fr1kin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fr1kin). After they reached The Lands on March 25th using the 'BedTP' exploit, jared did all of the griefing, while taylo killed [Branillon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Branillon) with his 32k sword, and iTristan stood by and watched. After the grief, they travelled to [Oremonger](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Oremonger)'s clock base, where they teamed with C4RTM4N's group to grief it. Nerds Inc established a base called [The Archive (build)](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Archive_(build)), consisting of a giant bedrock dome and countless chests containing items, which he considered to be the second of 2 major bases he was considered himself to be a part of. There, taylo showed jared he could restart the server, teleport, and that they had obtained barrier and bedrock blocks. The bedrock sphere was removed two weeks later by [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster). In April, The Tyranny started the [Week of Destruction](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Week_of_Destruction), griefing many bases like [Space Valkyria 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_Valkyria_2) and [KinoGrad Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KinoGrad_Base) (the latter of which jared did not participate in), as well as re-griefing bases like [Space Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_Valkyria) and [King's Landing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/King%27s_Landing).

### Post-June and Incursions
#### The Chaos of 2016
Jared was online on June 1st when the Rusher Invasion began; he noticed in real-time the player count growing so large that chests would be corrupted whenever they were loaded. Before the Rusher Invasion, Jared started the [Fourth Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IV_Incursion) before [TheCampingRusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) joined the server out of boredom. It later developed into a response to the Rusher Invasion, but Jared eventually abandoned the project, after which [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86) took over leadership. During the 'Rusher War', Jared first participated in a 'massacre' of a 'Rusher sanctuary' with Fit and [BabbaJ](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BabbaJ) but was accused of having formally sided with [Team Rusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Rusher), as he proclaimed in chat he was now 'a Rusher' and for showing TheCampingRusher around the server to many landmarks, although he later claimed it was to help end his series and that he helped script Rusher's last few videos.

Ever since then Jared tried to get involved with incursions. In November 2016, [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids) started the [Fifth Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/V_Incursion) with jared, before handing leadership solely to jared, who attempted to build an obsidian wall around spawn. While many claim the incursion failed due to a lack of goals being achieved and jared leaving out of frustration, jared claims the incursion only failed because he left because of personal issues.

#### Incursions and Nerds Inc.
In April 2018, after the arrival of [AntVenom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AntVenom) Jared also participated in the [Sixth Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/VI_Incursion), which continued the obsidian wall project. A month later in May, he started '31Days31Griefs' during which he griefed a base every single day for the month of May, which he considered to be one of his greatest accomplishments. Most of the bases griefed during 31Days31Griefs was found via insiding, although some of the bases' coordinates were given to Jared by Fr1kin, who gave him information regarding the [Nocom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nocom) exploit despite his estrangement from Nerds Inc. In August 2018, Jared left Nerds Inc mostly due to personal conflicts with iTristan and other members and the fact that he felt isolated due to being the only member that wasn't a programmer.

In 2018, Jared got involved in multiple conflicts. In September after the arrival of [FuzeIII,](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FuzeIII) Jared once again took the initiative and started the [Seventh Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/VII_Incursion), with the goal of building a giant trench around spawn. Even though this project failed to achieve its goal, the trench was finished build as a separate project. FitMC often portrays Jared's influence on these incursions negatively, describing him as a bad leader responsible for the failures of both the 5th and 7th Incursions. The development of the 7th Incursion also motivated Sato86 to formally retire the name 'incursions'. Jared on the other hand considers these incursions and especially the 7th one a success because of the goals accomplished like covering the nether floor with lava and claims Fit was just mad that he was kept out of the project. According to Jared, during the incursion, he was pissed at [The Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium) for using their own voice chat instead of the incursion voice chat and sent an informant into their voice chat but he was caught. In response, [TheDark Emperor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheDark_Emperor) pulled out all his members from the incursion, had [Jordanl666](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jordanl666) terminate the incursion discord and a major conflict erupted between Jared and [The Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium). Jared had many other people inside the Emperium and as much as 2 to 3 insiders were within their Inner Circle, 25 or more bases were griefed and many of their members were doxxed, a development Jared feels partly responsible for and regrets. In 2020, Jared won the conflict as many in The Emperium were doxxed and some of their members were found to have access to child pornography.

In late 2019 as a response to the 'Taiwanese Incursion', Jared and [Armorsmith](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith) started the [8th Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/8th_Incursion), which focused on the construction of a water cube around spawn. Although the incursion once again failed, [BachiBachBach](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BachiBachBach) managed to gain control over the project and used it as a foundation for the [Infinity Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinity_Incursion). In early 2019, the conflict also resulted in false rumors being spread about Jared getting arrested by the FBI after he temporarily left the server. In may that year Jared, fr1kin, iTristan and BabbaJ griefed Space Valkyria 3 V2, making it the third incarnation of Space Valkyria Jared destroyed. In June 2021 Nerds Inc. formally announced that Jared's affiliation with the group had been ended, Afterwards, Jared started to leak information about the Nocom exploit on reddit.

### Later Years
Jared hasn't played much on 2b2t since 2019-2020 and has stated that he's not excited for 2b2t's future and doesn't plan to play on the server much in the future. For 4 months, his jared2013 account was chunkbanned at [Mu](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mu).

In early 2021, Jared was given [Autumnmelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Autumnmelon) coordinates and then had [Forceken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Forceken) and [illville502](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/illville502) dig him there; he had them overshoot the base as to make sure he could grief it without them. He then griefed Autumnmelon. Later that year, Jared, [Orsond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Orsond) and [HermeticLock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HermeticLock) gained access to the coordinates to 'Imps 2', a backup of Imps base that iTristan had made back in 2015 during the [Third Backdoor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backdoors), and griefed it. Soon afterwards Jared would have a falling out with orsond over personal differences and not receiving footage of the grief. Shortly after this, conflicts with [Joey Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) lead to Jared leaking the coordinates to [Whitehaven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Whitehaven), which jared established with orsond in 2020, and [Block Game Jerusalem](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Jerusalem), leading to the bases being self-griefed.

After this, Jared became inactive on 2b2t, now spending most of his time playing on [Constantiam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Constantiam) with fellow Nerds Inc. members. He still communicates with friends in the community to keep up with events on 2b2t.

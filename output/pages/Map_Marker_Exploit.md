The Map Marker Exploit was a crash and ban exploit utilized in 2021.

## History
The exploit was discovered by player [cityboss1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/cityboss1). After experimenting with item frames in a personal creative world, he noticed that the ‘green’ markers on the map were behaving oddly. Normally, the green markers represent an item frame in which the generated map has been displayed. Cityboss noticed that if item-frames with the maps were placed on top of eachother, the markers also stacked on top of eachother on the map. He and the player [rebane2001](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/rebane2001) discovered that stacking markers on a map severely lagged a player’s client. A second glitch was discovered, whereby entering the Nether and re-entering the Overworld where the item-frames were placed, duplicated the existing markers, extending the ‘trail’ of markers even more. The players had developed a new exploit that could severely lag and even chunkban players, depending on the strength of their hardware. A special module was developed that hid the markers, so that they were not affected by the exploit themselves. Around May 17th copies of the maps were placed around Spawn and on the [Nether highways](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nether_highways), kicking multiple people off the server. The maps also lagged and crashed the server, since they were sending large amounts of data to it. For a while players were unable to join the queue server or were stuck in position 0. Upon restart, all the ‘glitched’ map markers were removed but the ‘real’ ones remained. The largest map eventually contained around 700000 markers and stretched 10 blocks forward from the map’s surface. The admin was forced to restart the server and limit the amount of markers that could be displayed on an individual map.

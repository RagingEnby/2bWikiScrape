**R2bEEaton** is a builder, redstoner and coder.

## History
### Join date
R2bEEaton is a [Rusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rusher) by the common definition. He found 2b2t by being recommended Rusher's video, his first one, in fact, a week after it came out. The queue was too long so R2bEEaton waited until October 16th, 2016 when he got in for the first time.
### Menders
After a week of playing, R2bEEaton met a player in chat whose current name is [TheColorGreen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheColorGreen). They were on opposite axes from each other but were both new and eager to make a base. They, along with R2bEEaton's brother [_E2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_E2), moved out to the millions on the -X axis and formed a group (and base) called The Menders. It was a small group dedicated to repairing, being nice in chat, and being nice to any players they might see. They found a god set on the highway on route to the base and 2 days after they arrived at Menders base, the [11/11 (November 11th, 2016) dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/11%2F11_Dupe) came into effect. They duped that god set and plundered dungeons to find enchanted golden apples. Two gapples were duped into four double chests full.

Several months later, R2bEEaton noticed a few blocks had been broken at the base so TheColorGreen and he loaded up the stash into their legitimately gotten shulker boxes and headed out. The base was griefed within the next day by [http_logan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/http_logan) and his friends from the [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons).
### Oceania
They then went further out, roughly 20k in the nether more, then founded [Oceania](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Oceania) (which was not named until May 2018). It was on a small island which limited building opportunities. TheColorGreen built a tiny storage room and has only been seen twice since. R2bEEaton continued to build small things on his own and eventually found himself with nothing to do every time he connected to 2b2t.

On March 10th, 2018 R2 learned of the [2b2t Museum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Museum) and contacted them to submit a world download of the previous base, The Menders base. R2 was referred to [Beardler](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Beardler). They talked and R2bEEaton sent him a world download. Little did he know, the world downloader mod he was using used the server name as the world name. He sent Beardler a world download to his current base, Oceania, instead of The Menders base. Beardler took a look at the world download and replied, "If you want a basemate I could show up sometime next week." He arrived the next day.

With his (and R2bEEaton's permission) came an onslaught of players like [Brayin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Brayin), [MagicEx](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/MagicEx), [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids), [aaron_alvin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/aaron_alvin), [S126](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/S126), [Time_Traveler_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Time_Traveler_), [IHackedRoblox](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IHackedRoblox), [EatMcDonalds](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/EatMcDonalds), [math__u](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/math__u), [Dolls](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dolls), [CassiaValentine](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CassiaValentine), [Scribblefoxx](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Scribblefoxx), and [Offtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Offtopia) although he did not arrive

The base was leaked to jared2013 by Slappnbadkids as part of an attempt to spare his own base, Block Game Mecca, and griefed on the 27th day of jared2013's 31day31griefs. The night it was griefed, R2bEEaton had left to visit a dupe stash (that turned out to be a fake). This meant he left his contents of his enderchest in a normal chest in his house. R2bEEaton's house is now a crater because Jumpy opened a trapped chest next to TNT while he and Jared were looting. This explosion destroyed the same gapples R2bEEaton had duped a year and a half before.

Having nothing, Beardler and R2bEEaton went to spawn. Beardler showed R2bEEaton [Krobar01's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Krobar01) [MOAK](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Numenor#MOAK). He told R2bEEaton that he wasn't supposed to be there but that he could as long as he didn't tell anyone. Little did R2bEEaton know, Beardler would be the indirect cause of the grief of MOAK (see [BoeMeccan Witch Trials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BoeMeccan_Witch_Trials)).
### Builders Haven
Before the BoeMeccan Witch Trials, Beardler invited R2bEEaton to a project known as [Builders Haven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Builders_Haven), a base planned for 1.13 and originally having 50+ members. Since 2b2t had not yet updated to 1.13, the Haven group made multiple bases. R2bEEaton was at [Purgatory I](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Builders_Haven#Purgatory), which was leaked and griefed by one of the members, [Lifeisgood72](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lifeisgood72), who was immediately kicked. He was at [Purgatory II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Builders_Haven#Purgatory_II) although after 16 days, it was leaked and griefed by one of its members.They did not know this at the time. R2bEEaton was on vacation when Purgatory 2 was griefed so he missed [Purgatory III](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Builders_Haven#Purgatory_III) (joke base) and [Purgatory IV](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Builders_Haven#Purgatory_IV). Purgatory IV was leaked by the same person as Purgatory 2 and when they found out who it was, they were kicked. The next base's name was created by R2bEEaton. The fifth base came to be known as [Exposition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Builders_Haven#Exposition_Purgatory_V), however the griefers referred to it as "Purgatory V" instead.

### Valerian
Since the fall of Builder's Haven due to the leak of the final base location and drama with Beardler, R2bEEaton joined a new group. On September 30th, 2018 he was invited by some of his friends from Haven to a new group base called [Valerian](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valerian), named by [BigBatYT](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BigBatYT). In the months following, he was very active and managed to be the first (and currently only) person to ever reach +10,000,000 +10,000,000 Nether and was, for a time, the second farthest person out in the Nether. From then on, he became inactive without motivation to build a monument there and occasionally played at Valerian on an alt account. Over the months from January to June/July, R2bEEaton became almost entirely inactive.

**Steampunkjax** is a builder, basehunter and griefer, who has been involved in many projects and groups over his time playing 2b2t.

## History
### Early History
[Steampunkjax](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Steampunkjax) joined 2b2t in December 2019 but played infrequently for the next eight months. During this time, he explored the server, hunted for stashes, and built small bases and outposts. It wasn't until mid-2020 that he began to play regularly after joining the [Infinity Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinity_Incursion) and [Fight Club](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fight_Club) discords. Through these groups, he participated in community events and developed his skills and knowledge of the server. When the [Tenth Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tenth_Incursion) started, Steampunkjax was an active participant and helped place enchantment tables at nether spawn, which played an instrumental role in the Incursion's success.

### SBC
After the [Tenth Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tenth_Incursion) ended, Steampunkjax joined the [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate) (SBC). During his time in SBC, he contributed to the group's building projects at various locations, including [The Calculator](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate#The_Calculators), [The Calculator 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate#The_Calculators), [Halicarnassus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Halicarnassus) and [Gaza](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate#Gaza). Notably, he constructed a grand Neo-classical temple at Halicarnassus, which served as a storage facility for the bases Stash. While Steampunkjax was in SBC, he received an invitation from [bread_loafs](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/bread_loafs) to join the [Rebuild](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NFE#_Rebuild) project. This project marked the beginning of Steampunkjax's interest in the history of 2b2t and the collection of artifacts and would begin to collect historical items from various periods of 2b2t's history.

### Guardsmen
In early January of 2021, Steampunkjax received an invitation from [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) to visit [Adamantium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Adamantium). While there, he constructed SBC hill and his Redstone House. Following the fall of Adamantium, Steampunkjax became an enthusiastic participant in several collaborative bases as a member of the [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen). After taking a break from 2b for a few months, Steampunkjax returned and continued to be an active participant in these projects. He was officially initiated into the Guardsmen in September of 2021 at [Menegroth](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Formative_bases). However, in early October, the majority of the [SBC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SBC) dual-members decided to leave the Guardsmen due to [internal issues](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen#Leadership_Troubles). Despite this, Steampunkjax was recently promoted to the rank of Distinguished Guardsmen and decided to stay and try to keep the group active. He started a few new bases and initiated several new members, but some members of the group were unhappy with his position and decided to create a private group chat to voice their grievances and plan to remove him from his role. When Steampunkjax was made aware of the leaked chat logs, which contained negative comments and plans against him, he decided to share them with the entire group. As a result, he made the difficult decision to leave the Guardsmen, due to the lack of trust and respect from certain members.

### Astral Brotherhood, Donfuer and the 2b2t Party Commitee
In August 2021, Steampunkjax received an invitation from [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) to join the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) the nascent Astral Brotherhood along with a variety of other players. Steampunkjax accepted the invitation and quickly became an active member, attending every base and contributing to the group's efforts. When the group's base, [Astralia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Formative_bases), was leaked to the [Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column), Steampunkjax helped with its self-griefing to prevent it from falling into enemy hands. Around the same time, Steampunkjax was also invited to join [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer), another prominent group on the server. He accepted the invitation and began building at [DonFuer 22](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_22), pouring his creative energy into the project until its eventual griefing in December 2021. Steampunkjax also received an invitation from the [2b2t Party Committee](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Party_Committee) to build at their [Christmas 2021 Party Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Party_Committee#Christmas_2021_Party_Base), where he played a significant role in designing the event and even contributed his own creation, the Snow Monster, to the festivities. After the Christmas party, Steampunkjax continued in the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) and went to bases such as [Poppy Town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Poppy_Town), [Nautilus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nautilus), [Okab](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#_Okab) and would found [Capybara Castle](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#_Capybara_Castle). In the months that followed, Steampunkjax took a step back from the Astral Brotherhood to focus on personal projects, base hunting, and historical exploration.

### Insiding
Steampunkjax originally joined [The Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Backstreet_Boys) discord in October of 2020 and became friends with some members, however he would float in and out of the discord until December of 2021.

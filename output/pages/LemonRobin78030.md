**LemonRobin78030** is a *proud* member of [Bedrock City](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bedrock_City) and is known for her fun pranks on her friends at every base she visits.

## History
### Early History
LemonRobin78030 first logged into 2b2t on July 2, 2023, looking for something different from her then-typical SMP playstyle. She met UsuriousBerry39 on a highway, who geared her and enabled her to wander [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn). UsuriousBerry39 invited her to Base 1 and Lemon built a bit there. Around the same time, Berry asked Lemon to fetch a stash for him, and in the middle of the trip he invited Lemon to [Bedrock City 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bedrock_City_2) and encouraged her to join the [Travellers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Travellers). Lemon joined the group but participated little before the update to 1.19, when the Travellers merged with VEA and caused Lemon to become a member of the group. In Late 2024 she was removed from the group without reason, but maintains friendships with the group regardless.

### Bedrock City
Lemon arrived at Bedrock City 2 a month after being invited, where she immediately reorganized the storage and then helped to build much of the base. After a year there, the base was found by [Outlast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Outlast), and later griefed by [DuctTapeMessiah](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DuctTapeMessiah). Following the grief of Bedrock City 2, she moved to Bedrock City 3. She constructed several small builds at Bedrock City 3, and was active there until it was griefed by DuctTapeMessiah.

Lemon is still an active member of Bedrock City, hanging out at bases and playing consistent pranks on other members.

### Graybeard Geezers
Lemon was invited to join the GrayBeard Geezers through the friendships with many of their members. She was active at several Geezer Town bases, constructing fun builds at every one she arrived at.

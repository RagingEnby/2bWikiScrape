## History
Jersker joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) on December 31, 2020. He began base hunting and exploring soon thereafter, and continued to do so on and off in perpetuity. He became involved with a number of various building groups throughout 2021 and 2022, such as [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association), [Guardians of Andromeda](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardians_of_Andromeda), and [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood), but tended to nonetheless focus on basehunting. He ceased to be involved with groups in mid 2022, opting to focus entirely on exploring the server while listening to [Raaanch's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Raaanch) livestreams.

}}**Stone Brick Sanctuary (SBS)** was a group base founded by [Berkoes](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Berkoes) in late 2021.

## History
### Foundation
Stone Brick Sanctuary was founded November 2nd, 2021 by [Berkoes](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Berkoes). She founded the base after the destruction of her solo base. SBS was originally intended to be a small group base with Berkoes, [Suyeonchan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Suyeonchan) and [Jazz63540](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jazz63540). The base stayed small and unnamed for several months until Jazz63540 suggested the name Stone Brick Sanctuary. After this, the base grew to host about about a dozen members at its peak.

### Construction
The majority of major builds at SBS were constructed by Berkoes and Katzeflocken. Berkoes built large-scale industrial looking buildings, while Katzeflocken provided more intricate nature-based builds around the base. The block palette prominently used stone and stone bricks, hence the name of the base.

### Grief
On September 3rd, 2022, the base was discovered by [nutinurmacaroni](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/nutinurmacaroni) and the stash was stolen. Not long before that, blocks were modified around the base (such as a bed) that were confirmed to not have been done by base members. With the base assumed to be compromised, and possibly by multiple different people, Berkoes leaked the base on Reddit. [Dima788](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dima788) and [EXM1LITARY](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/EXM1LITARY) griefed the base on November 20th, 2022.

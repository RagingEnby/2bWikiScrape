**oofplux** is a [newfag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/newfag) that is known for contributing to the construction of Mapopoly (3rd largest Mapart on 2b2t), as well as griefing multiple bases/events and the oWo spawn symbol. He is known on the server for being one of the biggest cloutchasers, constantly appearing in [FitMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FitMC) and [fastvincent1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fastvincent1) videos, even being voted the biggest cloutchaser during 2022's 2b2t Oscar event. He is also one of the players on 2b2t with the most priobanned accounts (10 accounts).

## History
### Early History
oofplux started playing on 2b2t in late September 2020. He joined the [IIS](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IIS) and [The Lost Nomads](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Lost_Nomads). He built at the Lost Nomad Games 1, but was subsequently kicked from the group due to infighting.  He griefed the following 4 Lost Nomads spawn events. At the same time, he also was a key contributor in the [Air Destroyers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Air_Destroyers) and griefed the [Spawn OwO](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_sky_symbols#OWO_Symbol) with [Sand_Turtle](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sand_Turtle). He also helped grief the Rick Astley. He invented a packet fly destruction method with withers that can be used to grief any obsidian structure built at maximum height.  In October of 2021, he was invited by [orsond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/orsond) to help grief [Menegroth](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Formative_bases).

### Mapopoly
In May 2021, oofplux visited a variety of old bases through the course of a tour of the server. While conducting this tour, [Zeenyo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Zeenyo) informed him of some so-called "interesting ruins" at [Block Game Mecca](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Mecca). After going there, he he found the base's Industrial District with farms and carpet dupers. There were around 200 double chests full of shulker boxes of carpets. The area was only a couple thousand blocks away from the main base, meaning that few had found the location following BGM's grief. Zeenyo and the rest of his group, the [Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys) had taken around 200 double chests of carpet from the Industrial District already. oofplux and [Dawnfall_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dawnfall_) moved the remaining carpets to [t gang's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/t_gang) base. Dawnfall made a plan to use this carpet to make a large mapart called Mapopoly - a 2b2t-themed monopoly game. The map would've been the largest mapart on 2b2t at the time of planning, although by the end it was the 3rd largest. oofplux contributed to about 47% of the blocks terraformed for the project, and 1% of the carpet blocks placed. However in May 2022 Mapopoly was self griefed.

### Eclipse
In March of 2022, oofplux would join a discord server called [Eclipse](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Eclipse) led by one of his old friends, yfua. They would discuss the state of 2b2t and how the lack of new players had led to minimal community events and projects, and decided to try to do some large public projects of their own to revitalize interest in the server. This led to oofplux and yfua teaming up to create the 1st Eclipse. The project consisted of filling in the nether portal spawn areas, and creating portals on each of the 4 axis at 128,128. The project was opposed by the anti-Eclipse, who were led by maksitaxi. The two groups had skirmishes and fought during the duration of the project. A bit after the project was complete, oofplux was given full leadership of Eclipse from yfua, and he subsequently led many bases for the group.

### Operation Vacuum
In June of 2022, oofplux created a project with his friend [dino_2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/dino_2b2t) based around mining out [Spawn Sky Symbols](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Sky_Symbols). He assembled a team of over 20 players with this same mindset, naming the group Operation Vacuum. They did what they called "vacuuming" various obsidian logos, through which process they mined pieces out of the logos, albeit leaving them otherwise recognizable despite mining over 9M obsidian, with oofplux mining out 3.6M by himself using proxy accounts.  Spawn logos impacted included but were not limited to the oWo, the Imperial Dragon, the Star of David, and the seatb3lt logo.

## History
Fornicator joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) sometime in 2018. He played intermittently with real-life friends for two years, before joining the [Highway Workers Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Workers_Union) in 2020. After stealing materials from the group's stashes, Fornicator moved on to his own solo ventures. From this point forward, most of his activity in the 2b2t community was through connections on [Constantiam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Constantiam), as his focus largely shifted to Constantiam.

In August 2021, he was invited to [Rat House](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rat_House) by [Todarac](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Todarac). He briefly based there before leaking it to [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) in October of 2021, whom he griefed the base with alongside [Forceken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Forceken).

Fornicator remains active on Constantiam. He still maintains friendships with those whom he met on 2b2t and Constantiam.

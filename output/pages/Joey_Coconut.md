# Joey_Coconut

**Joey_Coconut** is a builder and one of the leaders of the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood). He has helped to lead a variety of groups, bases, and projects, such as the [Block Gamers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Gamers), [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen), [Endhaven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Endhaven), and [Tenth Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tenth_Incursion). He has contributed to many other bases, such as [Concord](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Concord), [Wawa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Wawa), [Five Isles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Five_Isles), [Sky Masons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sky_Masons), and [Whitehaven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Whitehaven). He also formerly ran a variety of community projects, such as the [2b2t Wiki](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Wiki), the [2b2t Census Bureau](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Census_Bureau), and [EveryoneBase](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/EveryoneBase)

## History
### Early History
Joey_Coconut joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) on June 12, 2015, and played as a lurker with common periods of inactivity. He traveled to the [Noob Ranch](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Noob_Ranch) and [Melon Road](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Melon_Road), and later built several small bases in spawn before going inactive. In late 2016, Joey_Coconut returned from a period of inactivity, became leader of a group of new players, and set up his first group project - a continuation of [Tugboat Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tugboat_Base). While operating his sanctuary at the location of [Tugboat Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tugboat_Base), Joey_Coconut met many players coming and going from spawn, including [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids), who soon invited him to base at [Invictus II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Invictus_II). Joey_Coconut based at Invictus II from early October 2016 to late November, when it was griefed by [NedaT](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NedaT). Joey followed the rest of group to the short-lived bases [Obliviscaris](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Obliviscaris), and [2b2t Creative Mode Project](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Creative_Mode_Project).

Joey became a member of [Block Game Mecca](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Mecca) upon its foundation, although he did not arrive there until being [BedTP's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BedTP) there on 20 April, 2017. Throughout his time at Block Game Mecca, Joey built his Brick Biome, CocoCastle, a village, and a replica tugboat from [Tugboat Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tugboat_Base). On 6 November, 2017, Joey_Coconut created the [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate) along with Slappnbadkids and _m_o_t_h_r_a_ at the base. For Christmas 2017, Joey_Coconut built a noteblock [Music machine](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Music_machine) rendition of "Oh Christmas Tree" underneath the base's Christmas Tree. It was also one of the earliest music machines built on the server.
After duping over 6 million bricks during the [1.12 Stacking Duplication](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/1.12_Stacking_Duplication), Joey built his brick biome at BGM. He also helped to dig for the base’s Industrial District, which housed  many autofarms and carpet dupers whose contents were later stolen for [Mapopoly](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mapopoly).

Immediately following the fall of Mecca, Joey_Coconut started and became heavily involved in the [BoeMeccan Witch Trials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BoeMeccan_Witch_Trials) against [Beardler](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Beardler), along with [YellowstoneJoe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YellowstoneJoe) and [_m_o_t_h_r_a_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_m_o_t_h_r_a_). He was also invited to [Eastmarch](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Eastmarch), which was later placed under his care and later became the longest-lasting continually inhabited base on the server. Joey quit 2b2t for a short period of time before returning to [Block Game Jerusalem](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Jerusalem) to begin building his area. During various lulls in activity there, Joey based at Rhodes joined the [Astral Order](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Order), and participated in the [Sixth Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sixth_Incursion) and [Seventh Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Seventh_Incursion). In the meantime he also joined and took over the [Democratic Republic of 2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_2b2t), before going totally inactive on 2b2t from September 2018 to May 2020.

### Return to 2b2t
In mid-May, 2020, Joey_Coconut started to play actively on 2b2t, with the foundation of the [JIDF](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/JIDF) being his first action. He founded a number of spawnbases for the group, through which he met [FamilyPumpkin6](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FamilyPumpkin6), who subsequently invited him to [Hopen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hopen), helping to reintroduce him into the community. After the base's grief, he invited the members to Block Game Jerusalem, reviving the base. At the same time, he became involved with the group [Crimson](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crimson), involving many of the group's members to the JIDF (which was later renamed back to SBC), and later to Guardsmen.

Upon hearing that [Mrbeast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YouTube_Tourists#MrBeast) had joined 2b2t, Joey_Coconut moved quickly to form the [Tenth Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tenth_Incursion). As a result of a general sense of panic, the group grew incredibly quickly. Following Mrbeast's exit from 2b2t shortly thereafter, Joey_Coconut formulated an entirely new plan with several members and revitalized the incursion with a new plan of placing enchanting tables in mass at nether spawn to make crystal PvP difficult. It was later found to also lag the server, which caused server staff to have to intervene several times over its several weeks.

### Block Gamers
Following the griefs of Hopen and Fort Aqua, Joey consulted with the remaining [Block Game Jerusalem](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Jerusalem) members, and invited many of the builders from the aforementioned bases to Jerusalem, which he revived with Slappnbadkids' support. The base began to expand again, and following a leak to jared2013, the number of nonmembers who knew its location also increased. Joey continued to lead Block Game Jerusalem and the corresponding [Block Gamers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Gamers) group, and constructed a wide variety of projects at BGJ, such as his feverdream village, Desert Tudor village (which itself was to experiment with builds to put at Whitehaven), and the Brick Biome 2.

Despite numerous leaks stemming from jared2013 (such as from Orsond and D_loaded), Joey kept the base going with sizable help from a variety of others shielding the base, mostly members of [Nerds Inc](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc) and [Team Pepsi](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Team_Pepsi). After BGJ (along with [Whitehaven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Whitehaven)) was leaked to a number of people who were going to grief the base on the morning of June 16th 2021, Joey leaked the coordinates publicly, and invited the [Spawnmasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons) to grief the base.

He started Block Game Babylon later in the year after a short-lived base between, and brought the remains of the group there. The base quickly went inactive, and remained so throughout the end of 2021 and most of 2022. He later revived it with with many adds to the Block Gamers coming from Astral Brotherhood, although he kept the group's operations separate as their goals were different. He constructed his Ishtar Arch and Etemananke there with help from the other members, before the base was griefed in April 2023. The group continued on Constantiam at Block game Constantiam well into 2024, but functionally ceased to exist on 2b2t, with its members simply shifting their focus back to Astral Brotherhood.

### Guardsmen
Joey_Coconut became a guest in the [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen) Discord server in late 2020, and was inactive there until December, excepting visiting a Halloween base of the group. He co-led the construction of [Adamantium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Adamantium) with [Orsond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Orsond) from December 2020 to January 2021 as an appeasement strategy after drama with Orsond that culminated in him secretly going to Block Game Jerusalem after having been leaked the coordinates by jared2013. Adamantium became a large base near spawn that was built as a cooperative effort between the [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate) and the Guardsmen. Joey spent over 100 hours building at the base in its less than 2 week lifespan because of COVID-19 lockdown, and was promoted into the leadership of the [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen) following the grief of Adamantium. He subsequently moved the Shortbus Caliphate's members into the group at the invitation of the Guardsmen's leadership, having decided to move away from the edginess of the SBC's ostensible theme. He remained in the Guardsmen's leadership until October 2021, having participated in nearly all subsequent Guardsmen bases. Following drama with Orsond that originally stemmed from the [Imperator's Base 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperator%27s_Base_2) grief and creation of Copenheimer, Joey exited the group with half a dozen others.

### Bases with Krobar01
In January 2021, [Krobar01](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Krobar01) invited Joey to [Whitehaven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Whitehaven) after seeing his builds at Adamantium, which were similarly to those at Whitehaven. Being the only member besides Krobar01 to be consistently active there, Joey became a co-leader of the base and concentrated on recruiting new members to the group. Through him, [Banana_on_2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Banana_on_2b2t), [_gigo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_gigo), [DocSmurf](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DocSmurf), and [Lunch_Katsu](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lunch_Katsu) were invited to the base. Joey focused on his castle for the majority of the base's existence, although he also built a town, and also a bridge infamous among the base members. Following the grief of Whitehaven, Krobar01 invited Joey_Coconut to [Five Isles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Five_Isles). Joey built there from September 2021 to December 2022, and built a wide variety of organic builds, although most were large mushrooms. He also built a tree, an underwater skull, and alien spaceships dueling some of Krobar’s airships. He also continued to recruit new members for the bases. After the base was compromised, Joey and Krobar self-griefed the base on December 16, 2022. Before the base's grief, Joey traveled to, picked the location of, and co-founded [Endhaven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Endhaven) with Krobar01. While there he built Lazarbor and Basilica di Santa maria Della Salute, while also heading up most of the base's regular operations and all membership adds.

### Spawnmasons
Joey_Coconut became a guest in the Spawnmasons Discord in July 2020, and then a member in October 2020. He built briefly at [Chunk Haven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chunk_Haven) and regularly attended meetings before taking a more active role in the group at [Sky Masons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sky_Masons), which resulted in many new adds to the group's guest list. While there, he built his large nether island, lamp island, Agaricalysium, and helped in various other projects throughout the base, such as co-designing the bridges from the center island, and helping to design and build center island. He also spearheaded a project that saw nearly all base members have statues built of them, but as stylized ghasts. Following the base’s grief, Joey started the [Spawn Migration](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Migration), which originally served as a Spawnmason base (which saw the start of their so-called Fifth Degree), and later became moreso a community spawnbase which resulted in many otherwise unrelated builders being brought together similarly to Rat House. While there, he built his Walking_Library, Double King, and Yurtwagon. Through the Spawnmasons, Joey also built at [Corner Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Corner_Base). He later helped to set up the group's so-called [Masonic Grants](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Masonic_Grants) program, outlining suggestions and potential best practices for its implementation. He gradually lessened his involvement there throughout 2024 before ultimately leaving the group altogether in early 2025.

### Astral Brotherhood
Following the twin griefs of Whitehaven and Block Game Jerusalem, [Rathause](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rathause) and Joey_Coconut began running a project at Rathause's year-old spawnbase, the [Rat House](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rat_House). Under their direction, and with assistance from Todarac and [villicool112](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/villicool112), the base grew to be the largest base ever on 2b2t at the time, in terms of member count (104), and one of the largest spawnbases on the server - at a distance of 30k from (0,0). This coincided with the disbandment of most large groups on the server, and increasing conflict within Guardsmen between Joey and Orsond, in addition to [Block Game Babylon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Babylon) coming to a standstill because of inactivity.

As a result, Joey_Coconut and LordGalvatronMC co-founded the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) on August 22, 2021. as As a result of continued conflicts between Orsond and Joey_Coconut, in addition to [BSB](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BSB) griefs, and [Log4j](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Log4j), the first few months of the group’s existence were filled with griefs, revenge griefs, and insiders. Despite this, [Nautilus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nautilus) and [Poppy Town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Poppy_Town) were built. Following the losses of those two bases, Joey spearheaded a concerted recruitment effort in April 2021 that culminated in the construction of [Obsidian Isle](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Obsidian_Isle), [New Lugdunum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/New_Lugdunum), and [Helheim 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Helheim_2), among many other bases in that period. At Obsidian Isle, Joey built the Pride Fort. Joey_Coconut single-handedly designed most of [Lidenbrock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lidenbrock) in the week after New Lugdunum’s grief, although Lidenbrock was also griefed in turn a month later after [Steampunkjax](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Steampunkjax) leaked the base. After removing Steampunkjax from the group, Joey co-founded [Dubrovnik](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dubrovnik), which at the time was the group's largest base, and which lasted 9 months from 2022 to early 2023.

He followed up with [New Menegroth](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/New_Menegroth) and [Spawn Migration](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Migration), before going inactive for most of 2023. He returned for a month in late 2023, in which he helped plan [Vesta](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vesta), while setting up and running [Spawn Migration 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Migration_2) and [Concord](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Concord) simultaneously. Concord was the most populated base ever constructed on an anarchy server with 123 total contributing builders, lasting two months at a time where the community was significantly slowing down prior to the update. When the [1.19 Update](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/1.19_Update) occurred, he briefly moved Astral to [Constantiam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Constantiam), before bringing the group back and largely going inactive again for much of the rest of 2023. Returning in late 2023, he soft re-launched the group, pushing activity at Vesta, before re-opening recruitment that brought the group back to past activity. He brought the group into a sustained back-and-forth griefing period with [Graybeard Geezers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Graybeard_Geezers), [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer), and [VEA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/VEA) over objections to some of the groups' treatment of Astral members, before helping put a stop to the conflict later in the year.

After it ended, he led the construction of [Wawa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Wawa), Astral's largest base to date. Over the course of its construction, he withdrew his involvement from most other groups he was in for various reasons, reducing his involvement in-game only to Astral. Not long after, he reached his 10 year anniversary of having started playing 2b2t. Throughout 2025 he played significantly less, opting instead to facilitate inter-group cooperation and reduction of conflicts between them.

### Involvement in the External Community
On 27 July, 2018, Joey_Coconut became an Administrator on a competing wiki headed by [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013). After it went inactive, Joey_Coconut was brought onto the 2b2t wiki by [Dark_Annihilator](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dark_Annihilator) as an administrator, before going inactive. In April 2020, Joey_Coconut returned and planned with [_Henry_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/_Henry_), jared2013, and several others to remove the then-current administration and overhaul the wiki. After the community weighed in [Proposed Changes to 2b2t Wiki Staff](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Wiki:Proposed_Changes_to_2b2t_Wiki_Staff), the overhaul process began, and continued for several years, during which time he was promoted to Bureaucrat. After fixing much of the site, authoring 1/4 of its pages and 1/3 of its contents, he took a step back to simply moderating the site, before ultimately stepping down from its administration altogether on August 28, 2025.

Following the deletion of a wiki article about [Zltb](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Zltb) (the owner of the 2b2t_uncensored subreddit) in December 2020, Joey_Coconut's staff position on r/2b2t uncensored was revoked. Joey_Coconut co-founded 2b2t_uncut subreddit with [Orsond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Orsond) and nuked the uncensored subreddit three times in early January 2020 along with Orsond, jared2013, Chexhead, and Soiledcold. Joey_Coconut was later removed from the r/2b2t_uncut staff team after him and Orsond fell out with each other. The uncut subreddit was eventually given to Zltb.

Joey_Coconut also founded the [Discord Archive](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Discord_Archive) in 2020 after the [Media Archive](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Media_Archive) was nuked by [The_Grand_Lotus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Grand_Lotus), and co-created the [2b2t Postjune Community](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Postjune_Community) with jared2013 and [Sage_Mathias](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sage_Mathias), and previously helped to run [2b2t Online](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Online) as an Admin. He took over running the [2b2t Census](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Census) in 2023 after years of involvement with the project, and started the [2b2t Census Bureau](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Census_Bureau) through which to run it. He transferred ownership of the project to [LegendBake](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/LegendBake) in August 2025 after stepping down from the project.

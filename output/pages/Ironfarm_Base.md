**Ironfarm Base** was a base built in late 2016 just before the [11/11 dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/11%2F11_dupe) that housed several large autofarms, large builds, and a large stash.

## Foundation
[jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) and [fr1kin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fr1kin) founded Ironfarm Base following the destruction of another base of theirs they shared with [0xymoron](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0xymoron) and others, nearby. Following the grief of [La Rosa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/La_Rosa) by [Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids), [C4RTM4N](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/C4RTM4N) asked jared2013 to befriend Slappnbadkids and attempt to get his items back. Instead, Slappnbadkids, jared2013, fr1kin, and, later C4RTM4N became friends.

## Construction
[Slappnbadkids](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Slappnbadkids) was invited to fr1kin and jared2013's Ironfarm Base. When jared2013 learned of the 11/11 dupe, Slappnbadkids and fr1kin were some of the first players to be notified. It was around this time that jared2013 began construction of his massive "Hall of Thieves" there. Many friends of theirs visited, such as  [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan) and [Fake KnightVista](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KnightVista#Fake_KnightVista). It was during this time that iTristan released a video of the base that included bedrock. This is before the bedrock [coordinate exploit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coordinate_Exploits) was known, and would lead to the base's eventual demise.

Ironfarm Base became a hub of items, and stashes were created all around the base. The largest stash was griefed by fake KnightVista, but the coordinates were not leaked. In addition, smaller bases were found on the outskirts of Ironfarm Base, and Coordinate exploits involving sound (similar to [Thunderhack](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coordinate_exploits)) were used in the vicinity. The base was subsequently abandoned.

## Later Days
Slappnbadkids invited [Drathader](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Drathader) and [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) to the base in early 2017, although the base would not progress much farther. It was mainly used for autofarm afking and gear storage for the rest of its lifespan.

## Grief
[ChromeCrusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ChromeCrusher) used his  [bedrock exploit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coordinate_Exploits) to find the base using iTristanâ€™s released footage of the base, and gave [Parthicus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Parthicus) the coordinates. Receiving a warning from [AlphaComputer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlphaComputer) about the imminent destruction of the base, Slappnbadkids tipped Joey_Coconut off. Joey left on March 30, and BedTP'd to [Block Game Mecca](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Mecca). Parthicus reached and destroyed the base the next day.

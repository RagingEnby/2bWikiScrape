The **Fifth Column** (also sometimes referred to as **5C**) is a group of players known for griefing bases on 2b2t, and for Copenheimer, a program that finds and indexes Minecraft servers.

## History
The Fifth Column was founded by [orsond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/orsond), [PepsiLord420](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/PepsiLord420), and [Sakuya](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sakuya) as an exclusive griefing group. The group also claims to perform griefs as a service to others wishing to protect their reputations. The group first targeted [The Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Republic), and the player [Jakethasnake52.](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jakethasnake52) Within the month of December 2020, they griefed several bases, including:

* The Holy Land (Republic Main Base)
* Two of Jakethasnake52's Christmas Bases
* Jake's Frat Base
* Jake's 16 Million Base

After this, [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) leaked the coordinates to [Block Game Jerusalem](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Jerusalem) to orsond. The group refrained from griefing the base however, when Hermeticlock, Sakuya, and [PepsiLord420](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/PepsiLord420) dissuaded the rest of the group from griefing. The group remained inactive until three months later when some of its members (orsond and Hermeticlock) griefed [Imp's Base 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imp%27s_Base_2), which lead to internal disagreements and Sakuya and [0x22](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0x22) being kicked out of the group.
Shortly thereafter, and after 5 months of [Zetrax](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Zetrax) insiding [Builder's Haven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Builder%27s_Haven), the group acquired the coordinates to [Bernheim](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Builders_Haven#Second_Take) and [Limbosity](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Builders_Haven#Second_Take). Several members of [Block Game Mecca](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Block_Game_Mecca) and [Boedecken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Boedecken) were added to the group for the griefs.
In late October 2021, after drama surrounding the group the [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen), orsond targeted multiple bases [Joey Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) had organized. After convincing [Zetrax](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Zetrax) to leak [Halicarnassus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Halicarnassus), the group promptly griefed [Menegroth](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Formative_bases) with help from [Franknificant](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Franknificant). Following the grief of Menegroth, Joey and his basemates self griefed all other bases they had with Zetrax before the Fifth Column could arrive, including [Gaza](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate#Gaza), Halicarnassus, and [Astralia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood#Formative_bases). In June 2022, a second series of Joey_Coconut related-bases fell. In July 2022 The Fifth Column used the Boat TP exploit to grief the Spawn Masons End World Border base.

### Sky Masons Controversy
The Spawn Masons were involved in a controversy where members of the Masons met with a minor in real life and hung out at her house. The Spawn Mason leaker was upset with the way the Masons handled the situation, including the incident itself and how Spawn Mason group members tried to cover for their friends with alternative versions of the truth. This lead to the disgruntled Spawn Mason member leaking the coordinates of Sky Masons to orsond. A video was released by Fifth Column member [Bezopasan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bezopasan) on October 10th 2022 which included photos of senior members at the minors house and audio recordings of Spawn Mason members defending why the behavior was acceptable.

This lead to the Fifth Column gained access to the megabase [Sky Masons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sky_Masons). After confirming the legitimacy of the location on the test server, the group griefed the base on October 6th 2022. The group was joined by Storm Surge, the leader of the griefing group Team Avolition, who joined 2b2t for his first major grief. While the base was being griefed on the main server, [0Neb](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0Neb) griefed the base on the test server.

### Insiding the SpawnMasons
In early 2023, a player named [OldLadyNorth](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/OldLadyNorth) became acquainted and friends with a Fifth Column member named [CatgirlLana](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CatgirlLana).
In August 2023, OldLadyNorth was reached out to by a member of the [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons) reguarding her spawn kits, this interaction caused her to become a guest in the group. At this time she was asked by CatgirlLana to be her insider in the SpawnMasons, She has since cited her reason for insiding as being due to concerns about a SpawnMason's past messages about sensitive topics. Over the following year, OldLadyNorth spent a significant amount time and effort contributing to the group, and many of their bases, she also became very good friends with many members of the group. Slowly she leaked many projects including [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood), [SBA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SBA)  and [2b2t Party Committee](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Party_Committee) bases, along with a few SpawnMason and community bases.

Through her effort in the group, in April 2024 she became a full member of the SpawnMasons. This gave her access to even more base coordinates and a Gringotts location. In September 2024, the Fifth Column organized a grief of the group's bases, a leak of their discord chat logs, along with stealing the Gringotts stash. Following this, she was found out and removed from the Masons for insiding. This event is still highly controversial and a sensitive topic, such as leaked Discord chatlogs with inappropriate topics.

### Connect 5: Donfall
In October 2024, The Fifth Column were one of the 5 groups that were involved in "Connect 5: Donfall". [A1fastyellowgto](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/A1fastyellowgto), an elder in [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) at the time, reached out to [Bezopasan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bezopasan) to help grief all the active Donfuer bases at the time. Bezo worked in conjunction with members and leaders from [The Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium), [The Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Republic), [Backstreet Boys](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backstreet_Boys), Donfuer, and others in order to leak Discord chat logs from all known Donfuer discords, as well as several private discords used by leaders. They also tried to involve the [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) (who was originally meant to be group number '5' in the 'Connect 5' grouping) in the log leaks and grief, but the leadership of Astral instead warned DonFuer's leadership over concerns of violations on digital security and ethics surrounding the mass release of private chatlogs.

Bezopasan and [KitNightingale](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KitNightingale) published several videos on the subject, exposing private actions by leaders in Donfuer. They also griefed every active Donfuer base at the time. This caused 3 members to be removed.

### Current Activity
Fifth Column is still an active group on the server. Nowadays because of publicity gained from insiding the [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons), they have expanded and now hire people publicly to join the group.

## Copenheimer
During the Bernheim grief, orsond decided to steal the dupe stash located at the base. While attempting to steal it, he met a player named [rfresh](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/rfresh) who was also stealing the stash with [AlphaComputer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlphaComputer). They worked together to take possession of the large stash before [BabbaJ](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BabbaJ), a fellow Fifth Column member could steal and move it to [Gringotts](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Gringotts) (the mega-stash holding most of the items obtained by [Nerds Inc](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc) and the [Spawnmasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnmasons) during [Nocom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nocom)). In the process the two became good friends and decided to team up to create a program called Copenheimer, and started a project of the same name. The program exploited a simple bug in Minecraft's code which allowed them to search for un-whitelisted servers on any version of the game. They used an automated version of a script already in existence to grief multiple servers. The project led to players such as [WarLordN1k](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/WarLordN1k) and [Bezopasan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bezopasan) joining the group. The project quickly gained mainstream attention after [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) covered the project after the group thought they managed to grief the server of Minecraft head developer Jeb, which turned out not to be the case. They also found and griefed the Mojang Test Server that was used in several videos on the Official Minecraft YouTube Channel.
Multiple members of the group had their accounts banned for close to 10 years due to their actions of griefing Mojang servers as well as many streamer SMP servers.
After the Fifth Column was featured in multiple mainstream YouTube channels, other server scanning programs began being used to find servers to grief in similar fashion to the one designed by The Fifth Column.

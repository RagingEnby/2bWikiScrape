**HermeticLock** is a community leader on 2b2t who is most known for his involvement with [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer), creating the [World Famous Spawn Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/World_Famous_Spawn_Base), and being the former leader and co-founder of the [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Masons) group, founding [the Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/the_Guardsmen) as well as various other projects. In his own words, his specialty is bringing players together in interesting ways. HermeticLock believes that sometimes in order to have fun on the server you cannot sit around and wait for others to do it for you; you need to create your own fun.

Various projects of his have been featured by [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit), [SalC1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SalC1), and [BarrenDome](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BarrenDome) over the years. Cumulatively, his projects have over 20,000,000 views on YouTube since 2017. He runs the 2b2t social media website [2b2t.online](https://app.2b2t.online/) alongside [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut).

## History
HermeticLock joined sometime during [The Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Rusher_War) and decided to join [The Vortex Coalition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Vortex_Coalition). He was a high-ranking member of the Vortex Coalition up until the third phase of VoCo, known as the "Fall of VoCo" in January 2017. He became involved with the group [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer), who were a group that had come from several servers and decided to create their 10th base on 2b2t. HermeticLock helped with the build until it was supposedly leaked by [Coltsnid](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coltsnid). The base was eventually destroyed. In response, HermeticLock got a hold of the Vortex Coalition Discord after Colt "sold" it to him.

After the VoCo controversy, HermeticLock continued to be a part of DonFuer, helping with the planning of the 11th base. However, the base was never completed and HermeticLock eventually decided to leave the group, although he remained friends with [D loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_loaded). He moved on to create his [World Famous Spawn Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/World_Famous_Spawn_Base), which received a lot of attention from the community; there were visitors almost daily, and PvP was common.

## SpawnMasons
In 2017, HermeticLock decided to create the SpawnMasons, membership of which was designed to be significant and difficult to obtain. The Masons lasted for 7 months until HermeticLock decided to disband the group in order to avoid any sort of real drama or for it to fade away with time. The SpawnMasons decided to reform a few months after its disbandment. He now continues to play on the server regularly.

He has done multiple projects since November 2017, such as Project Shiny, Hermland, [Cloud Club](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cloud_Club), and others. He took over the [2b2t.online](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t.online) project, a social network to archive coordinates and photos of locations on the server. He also played a significant part in rallying groups to participate in the [Sixth Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sixth_Incursion). HermeticLock served as SpawnMason Worshipful from 2018 to 2020, and was instrumental in the design of [The Masonic Eclipse](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Masonic_Eclipse), building APIs for the bots.

## Guardsman
After leaving the SpawnMasons, HermeticLock formed the [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen) in May 2020. The Guardsmen were a group founded in May 2020 by HermeticLock, TheDark_Emperor, D_loaded, and Orsond. The primary ideology revolved around a base named The Homeland, which is close to spawn and was protected by the Guardsmen. When a Homeland is damaged beyond repair, it is moved to a nearby location. They also functioned as a normal group, making other bases and projects.

During the time of The Guardsman, there would be drama involving HermeticLock's former group, The SpawnMasons, where Hermeticlock would work with [D loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_loaded), [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit), and [AlphaComputer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlphaComputer) to grief The SpawnMasons main base [COVID-2147](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/COVID-2147). Fit then made a video[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icVqvRXOhZA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icVqvRXOhZA) on the drama and grief of the base.

The Guardsmen are now disbanded.

## Midnight Council
In December 2022, HermeticLock would found [The Midnight Council](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Midnight_Council). This event consisted of 25 of the most well known players on 2b2t, including Fit, [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa), [SalC1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SalC1), [D loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_loaded), and others. This was a group event that forced players in the group to essentially play in vanilla on 2b2t, and work together in a cooperative environment for the month it ran on. Many of the members of the Midnight Council would make videos on the event, which can be seen on YouTube.

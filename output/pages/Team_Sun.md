}}Fairly unknown by most, **Team Sun** started on another server known as "Spartan Empire" when ibiq and his co-workers started a server with the purpose to bully kids on Minecraft. They had multiple bases throughout the server until it closed and they jumped to 2b2t, announcing their arrival as “Team Sun”. When 2b2t declined in player count before the revival and [era of Rushers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rusher_Era), they moved to [Constantiam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Constantiam).

#### History
<p data-rte-fromparser="true">ibiq founded the team on his server "Spartan Empire", regularly recruiting new players for forced labor by pretending to be a girl. Notable members balonypony and vishusburn, who also aided in founding the group, helped recruit Jazukai, coconut4 and anonam00se. Some other players who wish to remain unnamed are considered honorary members.</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true">Together they've built, killed and shitposted their way to fame, but the name of Team Sun has faded into obscurity.</p><p data-rte-fromparser="true">In the absence of ibiq from his server, Jazukai sought to retain team spirit by claiming the leadership for himself, in order to command more skilled players. This led ibiq to create Team Moon, which nobody cared about. Leadership of Team Sun then fell to balonypony.</p><p data-rte-empty-lines-before="1" data-rte-fromparser="true">As of 2016, coconut4 officially defected and is considered a traitor. (The group no longer exists in any capacity.)</p>

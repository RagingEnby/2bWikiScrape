**Space Valkyria 3 V2** is a large [End](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/End) base founded by [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa) in early April 2018.
## History
Following the supposed leak of [Space Valkyria 3](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_Valkyria_3), [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa) brought [AlphaComputer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlphaComputer), [HermeticLock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HermeticLock), [Kinorana](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kinorana), [monaxide](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/monaxide), [Parthicus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Parthicus), [SilverKrownKing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SilverKrownKing), [xarviar](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xarviar), and [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2) to Space Valkyria 3 V2. Construction at the location was significantly sped up by the [Chunk dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Duplication_glitch#Chunk_dupe). Jacktherippa’s construction continued without incident thereafter. AlphaComputer left the base in early June 2018 to participate in the grief of [Purgatory 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Purgatory_2) with the [Shortbus Caliphate](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shortbus_Caliphate) in revenge for [Beardler’s](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Beardler) grief of [Boedecken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Boedecken). The base was actually found using [Nocom](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nocom), however, the fake explanation to cover-up for that was that when AlphaComputer intended to return to the base, he was followed out of [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn) by [fr1kin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/fr1kin), supposedly using a [Invisibility godmode exploit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Godmode), and when AlphaComputer’s pearl was [loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ender_Pearl_loading), fr1kin supposedly [Pearltp coordinate exploited](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coordinate_exploit) AlphaComputer, yielding the coordinates to Space Valkyria 3 V2. This is a very impractical and silly cover-up but everyone believed it. On 9 May, 2019, [Babbaj](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Babbaj), fr1kin, [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan), and [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) griefed the base. Following the destruction of Space Valkyria 3 V2, Jacktherippa and co. returned to [Space Valkyria 3](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_Valkyria_3).

## Architecture
Space Valkyria 3 V2 is a large build modeled off of [Space Valkyria 1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Space_Valkyria_1), and [Deep Space 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine). It is built predominantly out of quartz, obsidian, and glass of various colors. The main core of the station is a round tower of various diameters containing small ‘mimics’ of some biomes, as well as various crop farms, and a room filled with paintings. It also contains a housing area, enchantment altar, and storage rooms. At the top of the tower, there is the disc park: a great room with trees, grass, plants, and flowers. It also formerly contained pig spawners [player heads](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Player_Heads), including those of [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob), [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster), [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan), [CytotoxicTcell](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CytotoxicTcell), and Jacktherippa. Centered around an end gateway, the main tower is surrounded by a gigantic torus of quartz and obsidian with various modules, 4 towers with elevators, and 4 observation towers. Inside the ring is a rainbow road made of stained glass. Beyond the torus, there are five levels of rings mainly made of quartz and obsidian. On the rings and under them are a sparse placement of builds.

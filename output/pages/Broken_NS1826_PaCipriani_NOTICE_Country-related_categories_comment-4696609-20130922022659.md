The rest has just been removed which were "Competitors From (France), (Brazil), (Italy), (Macedonia) & many more etc."

If there is a total of at least 4 competitors from one country, then it shall be fine to make such a category, as long as the person lives in the country. Example would be as I would count for Denmark since that is where I live.

There is now only "Competitors From Ireland(6), US(25), UK(21) & Australia(21)"

**KinoGrad Base** (**KGB**), also known simply as **KinoGrad** and often stylized as **Kinograd Base** or **Kinograd**, was a group base founded by [kinorana](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/kinorana) and [OreMonger](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/OreMonger) after the fall of [King’s Landing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/King%27s_Landing). It is perhaps most notable for its role in the drama of the [fourth backdoor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backdoors#Fourth_Backdoor).

## History
KinoGrad Base was founded by [kinorana](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/kinorana) and [OreMonger](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/OreMonger) after [King’s Landing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/King%27s_Landing) was griefed by its members due to the coordinates being leaked by [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan). Many members of King’s Landing joined KGB, including [YellowstoneJoe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Yellowstonejoe), [Drewbookman](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Drewbookman), [Branillon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Branillon), and [SilverKrownKing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SilverKrownKing). One later arrival to KGB was [marcus4761](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/marcus4761), who was one of the founders of [The Monastery](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Monastery).

Major builds at KGB included VargaGirl’s VargaCastle, SilverKrownKing’s chateau, marcus4761’s KGB Palace Hotel, xarviar’s temple, Dorquemada’s house, a statue of a giant spider eating a pig, a large iron farm, and Drewbookman’s double mob grinder. OreMonger was well known for building massive (and often very laggy) redstone farms and sorters at his bases, and at KGB he built a massive sorting system, a large mob grinder, and a redstone-powered fireworks shop, as well as automatic firework launching systems and other automatic farms. High above the sorting system was a massive sun made of stained glass, and next to the sorter was a small fountain with a firework system built under it. A red and white “KinoGrad” sign was built above the fountain, with the name translated to Russian on the back. A Nether hub was also built out of ice and iron blocks. Many builds at KGB were never completed, such as a large castle named the Fortress City of Tyr built by [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86) and SilverKrownKing as a “Valkyrian Embassy”.

The base was griefed by [c1yd3i](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/c1yd3i) and [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan) as part of the Tyranny’s [Week of Destruction](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Week_of_Destruction).

## Role in the Fourth Backdoor
After the grief, [Drewbookman](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Drewbookman) claimed on the subreddit that Sato had leaked the base to the Tyranny, albeit without providing any substantial evidence. This information should be taken with a grain of salt as Drew and Sato have hated each other ever since Drew griefed [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria_(base)).

The grief of KGB was one of the key pieces of evidence that Sato pointed to when revealing the existence of the [fourth backdoor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backdoors#Fourth_Backdoor), going as far as calling the base “the savior of 2b2t” for what it had revealed. According to Skype logs released by Sato in that same post, evidence of the backdoor was leaked by members of KGB, which was then griefed by the Tyranny in retaliation. After the grief, Bran was enraged that the backdoor had been leaked because he had ties to iTristan. This account was immediately disputed by Tristan, Bran, [OreMonger](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/OreMonger), and [kinorana](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/kinorana), who each denied that there was a backdoor and that a leak had ever occurred. Kino even denied that Bran was ever at the base, despite his name appearing on KGB’s member board. However, soon after the grief of KGB, the existence of the fourth backdoor was conclusively revealed and it should be noted that despite claiming that he didn’t have any real ties to iTristan, Branillon eventually joined [Nerds Inc](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc). Soon after the fall of KinoGrad and the reveal of the backdoor, OreMonger and many of the other base members quit 2b2t, with most moving to [Constantiam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Constantiam).

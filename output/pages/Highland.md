**The Highland** started as idea in late February 2017, between [The_Grand_Lotus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Grand_Lotus) and [CasparovJR](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CasparovJR). Its stated goal is providing a better experience for players while staying independent and neutral to affairs of other groups. Highland is notorious for providing [newfags](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Newfaggots) with items such as golden apples and max enchant armor and is therefore blamed for enabling chat cancer and [spawnfaggotry](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawnfags). Highland currently uses no dedicated chat bot accounts, but some members (most notoriously The_Grand_Lotus himself) use chat-spammer features from cheat clients to compensate.

It was stated by The_Grand_Lotus that Highland's membership shifts both due to members being kicked out and due to them leaving and that members of the Highland understand not to become too attached to individual players, as they can stop playing at any time. The Highland agenda is not public, but it's stated goal is to continue providing a better experience for players in general.

The group has a Discord role system that starts out with Vassal, proceeding to Highland and then further, private promotions to Sergeant, Chaplain, or Knight. These roles are modelled after the 11th century Templar. The group also has a role for Non-Highland participants, which is a general 2b2t chat channel available to all players. Voice Channels include 2B2T, Highland, Great Hall, and Round Table.

Due to CasparovJR being invited to the [SpawnMasons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons) (after being a part of the Infantry Base and getting noticed by [HermeticLock](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HermeticLock)) and after a major disagreement with The_Grand_Lotus, he decided to leave for a better future on the server. The Highland, without him, is now notorious for many of the things mentioned above, and is much more of a [Crystal PVP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crystal_PvP) group.

After The_Grand_Lotus left 2b2t, the group went inactive in early 2020. [deathcurz0](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/deathcurz0) would bring the group back in April 2022 with the consent of The_Grand_Lotus. Many old Highland members rejoined the group. Soon, [deathcurz0](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/deathcurz0) would go inactive.

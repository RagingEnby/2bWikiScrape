**Plugin Town** was a base that was constructed in late 2011 and 2012. This base was built by [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob), [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2), and others using the TooManyItems mod, which popbob granted to them with her [backdoor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Backdoors).

## History
After [Passietown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Passietown) was griefed by [luke2thebun](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/luke2thebun) in December 2011 many of the members, including [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2), [passie05](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/passie05), [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob), and [policemike55](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/policemike55) left and founded a new base, Plugin Town. The base was originally unnamed.

Using a plugin that she created for [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster), popbob gave herself access to the TooManyItems mod, which meant that the base members had virtually unlimited resources at their disposal. Since the base was made during the Beta version of Minecraft, the builders were restricted to using the comparatively few blocks available at the time, so they did their best to make the base look nice.

Months after its founding, the base would become known as Plugin Town, named due to popbob's backdoor access.

### Griefing
After popbob used her plugin to teleport to various bases and grief them, Hausemaster removed the plugin that caused the backdoor. Soon after this, Plugin Town was abandoned and the players who based there split up. Later, the base ended up getting leaked by [omaliymix](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/omaliymix) and then griefed by [DSG3002](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DSG3002) and, as the years went by, also griefed by several raiders and people who stumbled upon the base, looting and destroying all the riches. [Coldwave](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Coldwave) visited the base a few years later and restored some of the builds, but they were eventually griefed again.

## Architecture
The base was filled with gold, iron, and diamond blocks, which were used as decoration and even the foundation for particular buildings. The first build that was constructed at Plugin Town was a central tower topped with diamond blocks that acted as a storage space. One of the most recognizable builds at the base was passie05’s "dwarf tunnels", a series of large underground tunnels decorated with obsidian, diamond, gold, and iron blocks.

Each base member built their own distinctive builds at Plugin Town; [assassinraptor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/assassinraptor) built a Viking mead hall, [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob) built a small tower surrounded with a stone wall, [x0XP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/x0XP) built a house with a "0" made of diamond blocks on the roof, [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2) built a huge mansion made out of sandstone, and [policemike55](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/policemike55) built a large castle made entirely out of diamond and gold blocks.

## Trivia
* xcc2 stopped working on his mansion after assassinraptor built his Viking house to stand in the way.
* Popbob and xcc2 were planning to build a large version of one of popbob’s trademark glass domes, but popbob couldn't get the outline to line up, got frustrated, and abandoned the project.
* The base originally had no name, and was only given the name "Plugin Town" months after its creation.

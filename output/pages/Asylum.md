}}**The Asylum** was a group founded by [Cityboss1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cityboss1) sometime in November/December of 2017. The group was prominent around April 2018 *(See: [Timeline](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Timeline)).* The Asylum has participated in multiple griefs and projects, along with many *insiding* attempts throughout the group's history.

## History
After playing on the server for over a year and a half, [cityboss1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/cityboss1) wanted experience with doing leadership. The Asylum was founded and the banner and logo resembles the old group he was part of called V Fawkes.

Many of his friends and allies at the time would join The Asylum and would become one of the biggest and active groups during that time.

### First Group Conflict
The Asylum’s first group conflict started with the [The Guild](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Guild) [SmackAttack86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SmackAttack86)’s newfag group. The Guild was compromised by Asylum forces in which they dismantled The Guild. The [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium), was considered to be an allying faction alongside, [Highland,](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highland) another large group on the server. With most of the members *bedtrapped*, alongside many of their bases being destroyed, the Guild fell, and the Asylum rose to prominence.

### More Conflict
The Asylum was initially friendly towards the [Peacekeepers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Peacekeepers). This was not to last.  [PandaSauceYT](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/PandaSauceYT) began to act increasingly provocatively towards  cityboss1, with the two soon falling out. The Asylum began to grief Peacekeeper bases. The Asylum also came into conflict with [Highland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highland) due to Asylum’s relations with the Emperium.

### The Vo-Perium War
During the [Vo-Perium War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Vo-Perium_Conflict), the Asylum aided the Emperium against the Vortex Coalition, for the roughly three weeks the war lasted. [Infrared](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infrared) aligned itself with VoCo, becoming enemies of the Asylum and the Emperium. Once the war ended, VoCo, the Emperium, and the Asylum made peace with each other. The Asylum and the Emperium continued hostilities towards Infrared.

### The UGE and AA conflict
When the Emperium founded the [United Group Embassy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/United_Group_Embassy) (UGE), the Asylum was the first additional group to join. Eventually, many smaller groups and factions began to join the UGE,  with the alliance inviting Highland, Infrared, and the Peacekeepers. However, these three groups betrayed the UGE, destroying the first UGE base, and leaking the third. The three groups then made official their own alliance, the [Alpha Alliance](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Alpha_Alliance) (AA), in which they sought to destroy the UGE. The UGE managed to fend off the AA and The UGE came victorious with many of the Alpha Alliance groups such as Peacekeepers and Infrared disbanding after The Asylum had destroyed and insided most of their stashes and bases with social engineering.

### UGE inactivity and the 6th Incursion
When UGE activity died down, the Asylum left the alliance. Once the [6th Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Incursions#Sixth_Incursion) occurred, the Asylum substantially participated in both the temp maps, and spawn. They were joined by [VoCo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/VoCo), the [Spawn Masons](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Masons), and the Emperium. The group fought the [Antfag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AntVenom) Invasion, and the former AA members during the incursion. The Asylum participated in being the first to killing the Enderdragon on the temp map and the construction of the Incursion bases and stashes. Halfway during the 6th Incursion cityboss1 became busy at the time and was unable to participate in the incursion any further. He was eventually demoted from one of the leadership in the [Sixth Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Incursions) Discord due to inactivity.

### Asylum Disbandment
Asylum disbanded in 2018 after the group had gone inactive. Many of the Asylum bases were abandoned or destroyed.

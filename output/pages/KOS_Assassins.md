The **KOS Assassins** were originally a group of players brought together by DrEnderPickles (Bezopasan) in 2015. A new iteration of the defunct group rose under the same leadership in 2020. This iteration was a spawn PvP group which reformed to battle the split off Snake Platoon.

## History
In early 2015 during the [Third Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Third_Incursion), the [Legion of Shenandoah](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Legion_of_Shenandoah) was absorbed by [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria), leaving all members in disagreement to fend for themselves. In a fit of rage, [Bezopasan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bezopasan), (formerly known as [DrEnderPickles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DrEnderPickles)), swore vengeance on [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86) and warned him that a team of elite killers known as [The KOS Assassins are Rising](https://www.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/4otowz/war_story_time_the_fate_of_drenderpickles/). After failing to originally gather members, [DrEnderPickles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DrEnderPickles) was attacked by the Valkyrians at spawn, then bedtrapped, and he then abandoned the server for multiple years, before returning in 2018. bedtrapped]]
By 2020, [DrEnderPickles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DrEnderPickles) had amassed a team of strong PvPers from across the server to take out the [newly founded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DL7sKanqWmg) [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen) at their home base. The group was able to kill many members and aggravate the Guardsmen by distracting them from making any progress. The battle culminated with the group performing a hit on the group during an initiation at [Aureus City](https://youtu.be/EcpAjicc8a0). [Tomad](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tomad) was able to kill multiple members with one crystal, but because [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) butchered the information, many members decided to jump ship due to a lack of clout and recognition gained from the attack. This resulted in a massive information leak to [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium) and many members changing sides. Dismantled and fractured, it was up to [DrEnderPickles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DrEnderPickles) to find new members who could be trusted.

During the attacks on the [Guardsmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Guardsmen) motherland, [DrEnderPickles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DrEnderPickles) met fellow YouTuber [Jakethasnake52](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jakethasnake52) and formed a close friendship with him and his friends. After the original core group fell apart, [DrEnderPickles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DrEnderPickles) made a base called [The Batcave](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Batcave) with [Jakethasnake52](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jakethasnake52), smeek_, and WiderThanEurasia, as well as others. However, after Jake found out that both [DrEnderPickles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DrEnderPickles) and smeek_ were not straight, he began attacking them personally, which created tension in the group, and ultimately caused it to split. [DrEnderPickles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DrEnderPickles) adopted all of Jakeâ€™s former friends into a newly formed [KOS Assassins](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KOS_Assassins), with an all new roster and with an all new mission.

On August 27, 2020, KOS Members smeek_, DrEnderPickles, WiderThanEurasia, and GayAustralia showed up to a [Jakethasnake52](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jakethasnake52) base after DrEnderPickles and Wider an insided. The grief resulted in [Jakethasnake52](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jakethasnake52) being bedtrapped, alongside other base members. The grief and bedtrap was recorded and posted on the [DrEnderPickles YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KY59rwTa6pQ).

The group would eventually disband later in 2020.

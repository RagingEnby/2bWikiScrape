**The Last Templar** was an exclusive building group founded by [King_Aurelius](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/King_Aurelius), [GenderPretender](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/GenderPretender), and [ForRussia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ForRussia). They were well-known for their bases [Argonath](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Argonath) and [New Argonath](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/New_Argonath), and for their 10k highway monuments. They tended to avoid griefing.

## History
The founding members of the group were originally part of the group [FrostGard](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/FrostGard), which was lead by [Vanex](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vanex), during November 2017. As the four players remained the only active members, they decided to build a base with plans of being larger than [Wintermelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Wintermelon). Eventually, on March 2, 2018, Vanex decided to take a break from Minecraft, and so disbanded the group. Two days later, on March 4th, 2018, the three players reformed into the Last Templar, named this way in caution of another group named the Templars.

For every anniversary since the group was founded, the members came together to build monuments 10,000 blocks out an Overworld highway chosen by [King_Aurelius](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/King_Aurelius).

On January 7th, 2024, [King_Aurelius](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/King_Aurelius) formally disbanded the group after prolonged inactivity from the server.

**TEA** is a map art group founded by [Noah3j](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Noah3j) in early 2020.

## History
TEA was created in early 2020 to facilitate the spread of maparts throughout 2b2t. To better accomplish this, TEA has reset maps several times throughout its lifespan in order to collect all map IDs. Following their map resets, TEA holds meetings in which the maparts they have gained possession of are shared among the members. TEA has had multiple meetings around 0,0 in all three dimensions at various points throughout its lifespan. Well known members such as [rebane2001](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/rebane2001) (Creator of [Mapartcraft](https://rebane2001.com/mapartcraft/)) and [THCFree](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/THCFree) joined the group for the purpose of preserving and collecting maparts while others such as [InvisibleXD](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/InvisibleXD) and [HighAtWork](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/HighAtWork) joined to create and share map art.

The group meets up occasionally and creates builds/events such as their Mapart Museum in early 2021.

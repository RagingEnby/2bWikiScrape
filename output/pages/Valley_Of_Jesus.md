}}**Valley Of Jesus** was a 2022 base founded by [bobbers22](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/bobbers22) that consisted of many [Jesus Statue](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jesus_Statue) [schematics](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Schematica#Schematics) being built in close proximity to each other with varying block palettes. It was built by members of the [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association).
## History
### Foundation
After the [Larptown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Larptown) rebuild was once again griefed, [SBA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SBA) members found themselves with no place to go except their spawnbases. As a result, [bobbers22](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/bobbers22) decided to start the Valley Of Jesus. [bobbers22](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/bobbers22) provided all the materials so nothing stood in way of construction of the base. Trusted [SBA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SBA) members were invited and began building.

### Construction
Most of the Jesus statues were built using Baritone and a schematic provided by [bobbers22](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/bobbers22), but some had to be built by hand due to the particular block that was used. For example, Jesus builds that were constructed with end rods, mob heads, or any other block that is typically difficult to place had to be done manually. The first week of construction (November 1st - 7th 2022)  13 Jesus statues were built to completion, and 4 more were underway.  By the 20th of November, [bobbers22](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/bobbers22) announced that around 50 had been built during the month. In the end, there were over 60 statues were constructed using more than million blocks.  The last of the Jesus statues were built around January 26th to January 28th, and the members elected to move on after this.

### Grief
The first person to discover the base was [Fantadtic_w](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fantadtic_w) on February 10th, and he began mining statues for materials, but left fairly soon. However, on February 26th, [Averil](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Averil) leaked the coords to the [Fifth Column](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fifth_Column) members after he was provided them by [Carezo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Carezo) as he wasn't playing anymore. [Averil](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Averil) did this as revenge for having been kicked from [SBA](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SBA) due to breaking several server rules, and the base was griefed with TNT.

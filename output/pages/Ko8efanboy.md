### Early History
Ko8efanboy first joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) on September 15, 2020. During this short initial period on the server, he joined a small spawn base run by [crzychris](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/crzychris) before going inactive.

### Canal groups
After two years of inactivity, he returned on September 13 2022 and joined the [Southern Canal Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Southern_Canal_Association). He became a high-ranking member after a sustained period of activity in the group. On February 28th 2023 he was removed from the Southern Canal Association after stealing the stash of [xForgeW](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xForgeW), who had fallen out of favor with many of the members. After the SCA dissolved, Ko8e was invited into the nascent [WaterWay Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/WaterWay_Union) by [Godroster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Godroster) and [ThebesandSound](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ThebesAndSound), becoming the group's 6th member and one of many past SCA members looking for canal work. He quickly became a high-ranking member there as well. After some drama with other players he griefed the 550k Milestone on the canal.

Ko8efanboy would leave the group after the drama, but remained friends with many members of the WWU.

### Building groups
In December 2022 he joined [The Collective](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Collective) and [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer), where he was intermittently active and rejoined several times. While in DonFuer, he led his own base, [DopeFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DopeFuer), and built at bases such as [Don Maximus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Don_Maximus) and [Blue Castle](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Blue_Castle). During this period, he unintentionally caused the DonShop stash's theft by [Neria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Neria) after sharing passwords to an alt account and forgetting to change it. He continued to be an active member of both [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) and [The Collective](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Collective) until he left DonFuer on July 28th due to his stash being leaked by [Max1mumChr1s](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Max1mumChr1s), a high-ranking member of the group.

Project Bricked was a spawn project organized between mid-January and March 2022 by the players [Fuzzy_Russian](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fuzzy_Russian) and [TheGrandLotus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheGrandLotus).

## History
The group planned to obstruct all of [Nether Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nether_Spawn) by filling it up with obsidian. Over the course of a few weeks, the group was able to place up to 4.3 million blocks of obsidian, almost reaching its goal of 4.7 million blocks. The project halted partly due to the admin temporarily increasing the ‘wither limit’ - the number of withers that could be spawned in a chunk - from 2 to 8. This allowed players to destroy much more of the placed obsidian than before and ended the project.{{Citation needed}}

The **United Group Embassy** was a inter-group organization formed by over a dozen groups on 2b2t in early 2018 to reduce drama and foster inter-group cooperation; it was also intended to double as a recruitment platform for [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium). It ceased to be active on 2b2t shortly before the [Sixth Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sixth_Incursion).

## History
The first iteration of the U.G.E. was created by members of Emperium and used the moniker "The Embassy".  Their goal was to bring all the largest groups together and have them collaborate in order to accomplish more impressive projects. It was eventually abandoned as the discord became inactive.

January 5th 2018 the idea was re-explored, and this time, took the name of "The United Group Embassy". This group was meant to not only include the largest groups on the server, but would include any group that had a sizeable membership and could be contacted. The [Asylum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Asylum) would be the first group to join the UGE.

[Infrared](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infrared), a group that had a rivalry with The Emperium, decided to destroy the first group build the U.G.E had made, known as the 1st Physical Embassy. This led to his immediate expulsion from the U.G.E and general hostility from all member groups towards Infrared.

With the creation of the 2nd Physical Embassy, Highland leaders [The_Grand_Lotus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Grand_Lotus) and [Fluffbuck3t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fluffbuck3t) joined the U.G.E. Previously, Highland had been represented by other Grand Masters. The 2nd Embassy was leaked by [Sniper231996](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sniper231996), as he believed [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013) had coordinates to a large group base he was a part of, and began giving Jared coordinates to slow him down. [Househousehouse1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Househousehouse1) arrived at the base, causing panic among members, and a decision was made to self grief. It was later revealed that Househousehouse1 had been instructed by [VoCo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Vortex_Coalition) not t destroy the base, and the 2nd Embassy had been in little danger at the time.

The 3rd Embassy was quickly started after the self grief of the 2nd Embassy with fewer, but more impressive builds. Only 4 days after the start of the 3rd Embassy, a sign was found at nether 0,0 by a U.G.E member group stating the coordinates of the Embassy. It was soon discovered that The_Grand_Lotus had placed the sign there as a sort of "revenge" for making what he deemed to be a mocking factionball emoji. As a result of this, Highland was quickly banned from the U.G.E.

After the start of the [6th Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/6th_Incursion), the U.G.E became largely inactive, with each member group doing their own independent work. There were plans to re-unify the United Group Embassy, but they have not come to term yet.

## Voting format
The U.G.E managed most of its decisions with a vote. There were 2 types of votes: Popular votes and group votes. When a group joined the U.G.E, a vote was held to give them full rights, after which point they got a designated "Voter" role. This singular voter got to cast their vote for the group during any important votes. This ensured that each and every group had an equal say on important decisions. These important votes were called "Group votes" because they involved all group voters. The other type was Popular vote, in which anyone in the discord could vote with a thumbs up or thumbs down. This was usually for less important things, or for events.

## Conflict with the Alpha Alliance
After the U.G.E. formed, Infrared and Highland created the [Alpha Alliance](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Alpha_Alliance) in response. Their largely negative and hostile view of the U.G.E. was due to their hatred for [The Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium), saying that they believed the Emperium had grown too strong and needed to be stopped, and how they believed that the U.G.E. was simply an Emperium controlled group.

Due to the Alpha Alliance's negative view of the U.G.E, several fights took place, usually with 10+ people participating each time. After the disbandment of Asylum, a U.G.E member group, most fights were unrelated to the UGE. Despite these battles, the U.G.E was primarily an event-based and building group.

The Asylum and the Emperium would always come victorious against PvP fights at spawn. Many Highland and Infrared bases and stashes were destroyed by the Asylum.

During the 2b2t tempmap the U.G.E groups Emperium and Asylum would plan a raid on the AA temp map base. All members of AA logged or died as soon as U.G.E came to raid their base.

## Disbandment
The member groups of the U.G.E eventually began to either focus on their own projects, disband, or fall into inactivity, and so leading the formation to also fall into inactivity. Eventually, it was decided upon to shut the Embassy down due to a relatively long period of idle existence in December 2018. The Discord server was later deleted on January 28, 2019.

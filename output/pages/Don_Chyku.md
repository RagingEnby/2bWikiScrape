**Don Chyku** (aka **Don Chykukanukakisaki**) was a Eastern-Asian-themed mid-rank [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) base founded by [Phosph0lipid](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Phosph0lipid) in early 2024.

## History
### Foundation and Planning
Don Chyku was founded by [Phosph0lipid](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Phosph0lipid) in early 2024 following the grief of [DonFuer 27](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_27). After having selected the location with various desired biomes (including jungle, mangrove, and a river), the group held a vote to determine the base's theme, ultimately selecting an Eastern Asian theme.

Selecting a name for the new base proved challenging, as many different suggestions were made. [Vethre](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Vethre) suggested the name "Kenchikufuer," inspired by the Japanese word for "architecture" found via Google Translate. This later evolved to "Don Chyku." [D_Loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_Loaded) however felt this was too brief and proposed "Don Chykukanukakistan," which evolved into "Don Chykukanukakisaki." Ultimately, "Don Chyku" became the commonly used name, and "Don Chykukanukakisaki" as the long version.

Before the members of  Don Chyku started to arrive, a signboard and a temporary pearl room inside a jungle temple were built by Phosph0lipid. Later on, the first buildings were made by Phosph0lipid, Vethre, [rainbowren11](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/rainbowren11), and [N8TT](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/N8TT), who set the style and color palette that would influence future builds. At first, the base was unorganized, with players building wherever they wanted and without a clear plan. After some discussion with Phosph0lipid and D_Loaded, rainbowren11 created a plan that divided the base into districts, each with its own style. During this time, [Warske](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Warske) made a large building across the river which would later become the starting point of Vethre's wall. Some other players contributed to the wall, including rainbowren11, [Dom2789](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dom2789), and others.

### Construction and Inactivity
After several buildings were constructed, and the wall neared completion, DonFuer started [Red Castle](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Red_Castle), which temporarily drew away most of the builders and halted the base's construction. Following the grief of Red Castle, many builders returned to the base; however, some members, including rainbowren11, were promoted and moved to build at [DonFuer 28](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_28). Consequently, The amount rainbowren11 was building in Don Chyku decreased, leading to his original plan being neglected by the rest of the builders.

Later on, many districts were established. Although they deviated from rainbowren11's original plan,they resulted in the creation of several new districts of the base, such as [Dylan539's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dylan539) "MUTOPIA TOWN".

Many of the base's builders found the original theme challenging, leading to its removal near the project's end. Plans were made to create various districts, each with a distinct theme; however, these districts were never built.

### Destruction & Aftermath
The base was discovered by [Dekto](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dekto) during one of his live streams, leading to its grief by him and several others. Owing to a separate signboard in Dylan539's area, they mistakenly thought the name was Mutopia town. Following the grief of the base, many of its builders were promoted within DonFuer, while those that were not were added to bases without specific themes to avoid similar issues as at Don Chyku.

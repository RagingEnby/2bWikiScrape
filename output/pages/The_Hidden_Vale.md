**The Hidden Vale** was an Underground Base founded by [Max1mumChr1s](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Max1mumChr1s) in December 2023 after the 1.19.4 Update.

## History
In 2023, after the destruction of [Don Maximus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Don_Maximus), Max1mumChr1s wanted to establish another base on the server. He found a location not far from his stash location that had a large ocean next to a mangrove swamp with a village, and he decided to make his base there. He had an idea for an underground base inspired by [The Boedecken](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Boedecken), so this was how he would make the base.

The name of the base: 'The Hidden Vale', was an nod to a group of friends that Max1mumChr1s is affiliated with on [Constantiam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Constantiam) called "The Vale". Many builds at the base were themed after this group.

### Foundation and Planning
Max1mumChr1s worked with [boojr](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/boojr) to transport many materials to the base location, and then excavated a small tunnel system underground which was where the signboard was placed. Multiple members of the base worked together to extend the tunnel system at the base into the large pre-existing cavern to the south. Boojr drained all the lava out of a lake and built a large open area for building. [SAPET](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SAPET) helped Boojr to make a large underground meadow at the top of the cave.

### Construction and Activity
The base grew slowly, with members periodically coming back and building more. Each member of the base dug out their own area where they constructed rooms for themselves. Many friends of Max1mumChr1s and Boojr came onto the server from Constantiam, and they called the base home. For many of them, this base was the first and only reason any of them played on 2b2t.

Large rooms were built for bigger projects like the underground tower that came up into the ocean, and the meeting room with the 'Vale Tree'. Max1mumChr1s also built several floating islands underground that were hanging from the ceiling and from each other with iron block chains.

Boojr constructed a large forge with a Dragon Head entrance in the cavern area, and also started work on a Cathedral.

When Jalapeno690 arrived, he opted to build above ground, demolishing the existing village and building a small town center.

TorturedCosine spent most of his time at the base building farms for materials, and he constructed a large room to show all different kinds of blocks and animals.

In mid-2024, members of [Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperials) showed up to the base, claiming that they had found the base from hunting trails. They built a few smaller houses above ground at the base in the area that Jalapeno690 had made his Town Square.

### Destruction & Aftermath
In July 2024, it was found that members of [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium) had received the coordinates to The Hidden Vale from Imperials. It was decided by the base members that the base would be self-griefed instead of allowing Emperium to grief.

Base members gathered in front of the signboard for a screenshot, and then destroyed the base.

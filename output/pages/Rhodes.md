**Rhodes** was a large base, and, in its heyday, was the oldest active base on the server.

## Foundation
Rhodes was founded in 2012 by [Andrew_Gill](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Andrew_Gill), shortly after the original destruction of [Boatmurdered](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Boatmurdered). In the base's early stages, the population consisted of Andrew_Gill, [core468](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/core468), [Kiwiololo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kiwiololo), [ohrahrah](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ohrahrah), [Rokoshoebo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rokoshoebo), and [Zenomorphh](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Zenomorphh). The base was inhabited until 2013, when many of the aformentioned players quit for good, leaving behind tombs for themselves to symbolize their exit. From 2013 to 2015, nothing occurred at the base. In 2015, Andrew_Gill logged in once more, and struck up a conversation with [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013). Although he had not been online in over two years, jared2013 remembered him. This conversation and jared2013's remembrance of him led Andrew_Gill to share Rhodes' coordinates with jared2013.

## Revitilization
jared2013 promptly set out towards the base, and settled there as his primary residence in late 2015. Over the next year, Jared improved the base, settling away from the original city to identify the new from the old Rhodes. Jared continued to invite new people to the base for the next couple of years, and the base grew to be sizable, eventually boasting over 30 members, of which around 15 were active. During the [Crafting Dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Duplication_Glitches), [zuzzlan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/zuzzlan) duplicated many unique items for the base, many of which are still in circulation today.

## Grief
The base continued to thrive until September 2017, when it was discovered that [Parthicus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Parthicus) had the coordinates, and had begun moving the contents of the stash away from the base. Rather than allow his base to be griefed by another, jared2013 took it upon himself to grief Rhodes, and so the base fell in mid September 2017.

The **obsidian roof** is a large platform of obsidian above the [spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/spawn) region of the [Overworld](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Overworld). It is built at a build limit (Y=255) for maximum impact.

The roof has been expanded over the years by many different players, groups, and initiatives, from just a small roof over 0,0 to its current status, which is a massive obsidian platform, mostly square in shape, of over 4.2 million blocks.

## Obsidian Sky Group
The first attempt at making an obsidian roof at [spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/spawn) was done by the group Obsidian Sky. Their reason for doing this was so that it would make spawn more difficult by having [newfags](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/newfags) spawn under the roof, thus making it dark and harder to see for vanilla players without [cheat clients](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cheat_Clients). Eventually, the Obsidian Sky group got bored and only completed random patches of their goal which was a square from -500 to +500.

## The circle
After building [The Masonic Eclipse](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Masonic_Eclipse), the software was repurposed to build a circle at spawn. The radius was 710 blocks so that it would extend the corner of the previous square (because 710 â‰ˆ sqrt(2)*500). It was built in early 2020 and was about 800,000 obsidian placed to bring it from a "square" to a circle to invoke irony amongst the community (as Minecraft has no circular objects).

The [2b2t atlas map](https://2b2tatlas.com/map) also uses the map as of when the circle was full. The black circle at the center isn't a mistake, it's an actual disc of obsidian in that shape.

## Infinity Incursion
Another extension to the obsidian roof over spawn was started by the [Infinity Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infinity_Incursion) in mid-2020. This attempt utilized a recently added "autobuild" module in [Salhack](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cheat_Clients) which allowed semi-automatic platform building. Members of the II got to work, and within a few weeks, the roof was created. This extension was a square from -1025 to +1025 on both axes.

## Linked Horizon Sky
The most recent extension to the obsidian roof was built by the [Linked Horizon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Linked_Horizon_Wall) group in the summer of 2021. After the completion of the [Linked Horizon Wall](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Linked_Horizon_Wall), the group wanted to begin a new project, so players [Nonus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nonus) and [Futsin1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Futsin1) began discussing ideas about what they should do. Eventually they came to the obvious answer; building a ceiling above their previous Linked Horizon Wall. The ceiling would be in the shape of a circle, with a radius of 2048 blocks. [IronException](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IronException) calculated the amount of blocks needed, and [ThebesandSound](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Thebesandsound) provided the necessary obsidian he had obtained previously from the [Chunk Dupe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Dupes).  Using scaffold, anti-no fall and eventually [Lambda](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cheat_Clients) highway tools, the group began expanding the roof, and finally after 6 months, on January 6th, 2022, they placed the final blocks on the roof, finishing the project. Along with the highways, and the [SpawnMason](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnMasons) Logo, the Linked Horizon Structure is one of the largest structures on 2b2t by volume.

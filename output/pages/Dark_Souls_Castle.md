}}The **Dark Souls Castle** is one of the most well-known builds on 2b2t. It was built during 2013 by the player [SpoilerAlert](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpoilerAlert). The iconic duel between [Rusher](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheCampingRusher) and [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit) took place here during the peaks of [the Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/the_Rusher_War).

## Architecture
The build is based on several areas from Dark Souls I, including [Firelink Shrine](https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Firelink_Shrine), [Undead Burg](https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Undead_Burg), and [Undead Parish](https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Undead_Parish) almost in their entirety, as well as small parts of the [Valley of Drakes](https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Valley_of_Drakes), [Sen's Fortress](https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Sen%27s_Fortress), [Darkroot Garden](https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Darkroot_Garden), [Blighttown](https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/Blighttown), and [New Londo Ruins](https://darksouls.fandom.com/wiki/New_Londo_Ruins). The build is extremely detailed to almost perfectly replicate the original game, with much of the landscape completely overhauled and an intentionally ruined look to match.

## Rusher War
During the heights of the Rusher War, the famous duel between Rusher and Fit took place in the Dark Souls Castle. In August 5th, 2016, Fit invited Rusher to a duel. Rusher agreed, and the two fought here. The battle ended in Fit's victory.

## Demolition
While throughout its lifespan it has had parts blown off of it or partially griefed by new players due to its close proximity to spawn, the base wasn't properly griefed until December 8, 2017, where Lifeisgood72 decided to grief it with Sevorus using more than 4 inventories of TNT. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/YcFZi) is the album showing pictures of the base while it was being griefed.

## Rebuild
The castle was rebuilt (at a separate location) for the [Fight Club](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fight_Club) event commemorating the 5th anniversary of the Rusher War, on June 1, 2021.

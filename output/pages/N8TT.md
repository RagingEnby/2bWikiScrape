**N8TT** is a leader in [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer).

## History
### Donfuer
In March 2022, N8TT first logged into 2b2t, seeking new experiences beyond the limitations of other anarchy servers. On June 30th, he discovered the current [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) Ranger base named [Katadalanfrantaranfueristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Katadalanfrantaranfueristan). Shortly after finding the base and leaving a sign, [Joetheblu3](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joetheblu3) reached out to N8TT, and extended an invitation to join [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer). N8TT accepted the offer, and became an active and dedicated member of the group.

Starting at the rank of Ranger, N8TT's commitment to the group and contributions caught the attention of [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) leadership. As a result, he was invited to participate in the [Aureus City](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Aureus_City) 2022 Rebuild. Leaders in Donfuer were impressed by N8TT's skills and dedication, and he was promoted to Men-at-Arms, and was made a full member of Donfuer. After this event, N8TT was invited to [DonFuer 25](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_25). Here he worked alongside other members to construct the suburbs area, and added many decorations to the base. He became friends with other members of the base like [AlexkooJ](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/AlexkooJ), [Joetheblu3](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joetheblu3), and [Xblaze](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Xblaze).

N8TT was promoted to Elder in Donfuer after Donfuer 25, and was given more authority in the group. N8TT oversaw the overhauling of Donfuer's Recruitment practices, working with [Thnks_CJ](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Thnks_CJ) to design bots used in the Donfuer Discords that streamlined many of these processes. N8TT also began helping to manage materials and delivery of materials to the many bases that Donfuer was involved in.

N8TT was integral in the establishment and operations of many of the group's bases such as SteamFuer, FutureFuer, MooMoo Cowtown, and Red Castle.

The next major base that N8TT was involved in with Donfuer was [Donfuer 28](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer_28). He was one of the founding members of the base, helping [Lukent](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lukent) and [D_loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_loaded) to clear and prep the area for the center island of the base. N8TT helped to construct many small and medium builds around the base, including constructing his own area on the main island and Evil Island. N8TT also oversaw the construction of interiors in every building on the main island and many of the houses around the base. He also worked with [Max1mumChr1s](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Max1mumChr1s) to bring many of the maps that were kept at the base. Near the end of the life of the base, N8TT built a scale model of the "Planet Express Ship" from "Futurama", which many members of the base thought was incredibly cool. N8TT oversaw and managed this base alongside Lukent & [Deathstar784](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Deathstar784).

N8TT was one of the members of the base that self-griefed Donfuer 28 when it was found out that the base had been leaked to [Outlast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Outlast).

Since then, N8TT has remained an active and valued member of [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer). He helps to lead the group, and manages many of the Scout Bases.

### The Collective
N8TT was a member of [The Collective](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Collective), a group started by [Toska2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Toska2b2t) & Lukent. He became one of the leaders in the group and helps to manage the many projects and operations of the group, but is no longer a member of group.

### Wingston
In addition to [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) and [The Collective](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Collective), N8TT was a member of [Wingston](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Wingston), another notable faction within 2b2t. He was invited to the group by [Warske](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Warske), and helped to manage the accounts used by the group for their building projects, but is no longer a member of the group.

### GrayBeard Geezers
In Mid-2023, alongside many other members of Donfuer, N8TT was invited to join [The Graybeard Geezers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Graybeard_Geezers). He has helped to build at many of their bases starting at [GeezerTown 5](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/GeezerTown_5). He has built at almost every GeezerTown base, and enjoys spending time with the members of the Geezers.

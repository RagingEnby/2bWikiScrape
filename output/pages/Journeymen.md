}}**Journeymen** is a collective group of players who specialize in hunting, and acquiring large sums of items.

## History
The group started off with [Maliktheking](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Maliktheking), [Bobbers22](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bobbers22), [Paulsteve007](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Paulsteve007), [BigGreasyEgg](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BigGreasyEgg) and [Davvvvy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Davvvvy), who regularly jumped around different group voice chats, collectively stash hunting together. Once these players started finding a few big stashes, they decided that they needed a more private group to voice chat and screenshare. The group was officially created, which first started off as "2b2t vc". As the group started to find more stashes, they would slowly add friends, and the group would continuously grow. Eventually, the group would amass a very large sum of items, and would release a video on it, showcasing their different finds which amounted to around 10,000 double chests of shulkered items.

In June of 2023, the leaders of the group decided to rebrand the discord server, and transformed into Journeymen. With their new identity, they were able to represent their personal stash hunting group. They would start looking for other players who shared the same love of stash hunting, and the group would quickly grow to 70+ members.
## Events & Bases
The Muddy Golem trading outposts were a series of Journeymen spawnbases established after the players Biggreasyegg, [Tonepa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tonepa), [BIKMUNNI](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BIKMUNNI) and Davvvvvy started betting firework dubs on games of Uno. These bases were used to trade items, regear, and larp. One notable thing to come from the base was when BIKMUNNI hired 'the fat man' on cameo to make a video encouraging Tonepa to pay him back for firework dubs that he was owed from a game of Uno, otherwise he would "negative rep him in the book discord".  At Muddy Golem 3, [jackafa_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jackafa_) was running [minecraft_simon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/minecraft_simon)'s coord spoofer, which caused him to accidentally build the "Sus Paul" and SBA Confederate flag completely misaligned to the chunks.

In Christmas 2023, the group decided to host a Secret Santa for the group, where participants would give in game items / services to each other for Christmas, without knowing who the gifter was. The event was a huge success, with around 20 participants.

As of recent, the group has started hosting raffles within their group. Participants can enter the raffle by uploading screenshots or videos of themselves finding stashes/bases in the given month. Each find is an entry into the random draw, and a prize is given out of at the end of the month. The winner of the raffle in May was [Beardo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Beardo), who was given 5 dubs of assorted items such as rockets, elytras, golden apples etc.

## Funding
As a group of base hunters, Journeymen have acquired many items on the server, and has had the goal to give back in any way possible. The group often give in game items to other large groups such as [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association) and [Astral Brotherhood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Astral_Brotherhood) to help fund their bases. There has also been a lot of individual fundings, with large bases and projects such as [Motorway Extension Gurus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Motorway_Extension_Gurus), [Spawn Migration](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Migration), [2b2t Oscars](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_Oscars) and other projects.

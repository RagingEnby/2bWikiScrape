## History
Willy joined sometime after April in 2011. Having being invited by his IRL friend, [Elocdrof](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Elocdrof), he soon joined The Judge's Group and its first base, [Old Town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Old_Town). In November 2011 (after [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob) griefed Old Town) Willy, along with the rest of the group, went on to build many other bases. Willyroof took his dog (which he tamed in Old Town) with him throughout this time, even to [1Mil Town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/1Mil_Town). He based at [Summermelon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Summermelon) in 2017, being a later addition to the base along with [Offtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Offtopia) and [CytotoxicTcell](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/CytotoxicTcell). He also helped found and based at [Mu](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mu).

Willyroof is also widely known for his pet wolf "wolfly" being the oldest dog on 2b2t, although it has since gone missing.

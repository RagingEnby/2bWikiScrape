## Overview
Vick is a [Newfag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Newfag) who has owned *Minecraft* since 2013. Since then, he has played the game on a consistent basis. Vick became familiar with [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) following the dawn of the [Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rusher_War) in 2016.
## History
### 2020
Vick first joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) on June 18, 2020 under his old alias, "AlphaFlame__"**.** His friend, Thrashin, started a small group with a few other friends and was eventually known as [No Cane No Gain](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/No_Cane_No_Gain)**.** Their first base, [The Oppidum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/List_of_small_bases), began construction in June of 2020. The base was frequently worked on throughout the summer of 2020. Although, during the construction of the base, the coordinates were leaked (at the knowledge of the group). [The Oppidum](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/List_of_small_bases) was griefed by the end of the summer by approximately five users. Vick, plus his fellow small group members did not return to the server for several months.

#### 2021
Vick returned to [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) on February 15, 2021. Alongside [No Cane No Gain](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/No_Cane_No_Gain) (featuring new group members)**,** they started a second base. This base was worked on inconsistently throughout 2021 and was eventually found as a result of a [coordinate exploit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/coordinate_exploit) in the summer of 2021. The unfinished base remains intact, but dubs of building materials, armor, and fireworks were looted. The coordinates and screenshots of the base remain disclosed.

#### 2022
By June of 2022, Vick had made another return to [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t). At this point, [No Cane No Gain](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/No_Cane_No_Gain) had been inactive, and the only primary members of the old group semi-active on the server were Vick and his friend, Thrashin. At this point in time, their next actions on [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) are uncertain.

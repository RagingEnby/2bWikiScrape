}}**Toro's Theater** was a base built by [Torogadude](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Torogadude) in 2017 after accidentally dying at [Death Star II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Death_Star_II). It was griefed later that year following its accidental leak on a livestream.

## History
On the 25th of February, 2017, Toro's Theater was started as a stop-gap on Torogadude's channel, because he had accidentally died in the [End](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/End) while afk at [Death Star II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Death_Star_II). As Death Star II was rather monotonous to construct, as well as difficult to reach, torogadude began construction on his theater.

After about two months, Toro showed off the complete build, but during his live stream, he accidentally leaked the coordinates while taking a world download of the theater. But eventually griefers quickly arrived to blow up the base, namely, [Peeke](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Peeke), [Babbaj](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Babbaj), [http_logan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/http_logan), and [0x22](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/0x22). Torogadude assisted in the grief as well.

## Architecture
The base was completely underground and, as the name implies, was a large theater. The base was completely made out of wooden planks and other wooden material (specifically birch and acacia) it was also built with clay blocks and stone bricks.

**Judge's Group** was a group founded in 2011. Judge's Group started when [Offtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Offtopia) and [THEJudgeHolden](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/THEJudgeHolden) started to save [newfags](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/newfags) from spawn and lead them to their new base called Old Town. The group later built at [Ravenholm](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ravenholm), Ravendel, Rapture 1, Rapture 2, Snow Town, and [The Drain](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Drain). The group's members also participated prominently in [1 Million Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/1_Million_Base) and [Rapture 3](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rapture_3).

## History
### Founding and early activities
Around the time THEJudgeHolden first joined 2b2t on an alt account of Offtopia, Judge founded Old Town in April of 2011. Offtopia came to the base, and proposed the initial idea of the group. The group recruited its first members; [jdw99666](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jdw99666), [elocdrof](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/elocdrof), [marksman77](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/marksman77), [willyroof](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/willyroof), [bubbakennedy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/bubbakennedy), and [square_digger](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/square_digger). Old Town had frequent visitors and was an extremely active base. [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob) later destroyed it in November of 2011.

Shortly after, the group moved on to build Ravenholm, an island base, and [Ravendel](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ravendel), which was also destroyed by [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob).
Several members participated in [omalymix](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/omalymix)'s [1 Million Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/1_Million_Base), leading to a common misconception that it was a Judge's Group project.

While the respective group members were there, there were also no other active Judge's Group projects. [chrisleighton](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/chrisleighton) was introduced to Judge's Group at 1 Million Base, and became a core member.

### Rapture 1
Following the grief of 1 Million Base, many members of Judge's Group had been creating successive temp bases in attempts to avoid [x0XP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/x0XP) and [policemike55](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/policemike55), so they wanted a more permanent base to build at. On March 22, 2012, Rapture 1 was founded with members willyroof, THEJudgeHolden, elocdrof, [Rickenman](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rickenman), jdw99666, [XY_Spencer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/XY_Spencer), [Royal_McKeogh](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Royal_McKeogh), chrisleighton, & [Pylon55](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pylon55). It lasted until April 21st of the same year, when [Royal_McKeogh](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Royal_McKeogh) leaked it because chrisleighton filled up his house with dirt as a prank.

### Rapture 2
Rapture 2 was founded on the same day a few thousand blocks away from the first Rapture. Rapture 2 was an underwater ocean base with the same members as the previous base, excepting [XY_Spencer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/XY_Spencer) & [Royal_McKeogh](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Royal_McKeogh). It was leaked to [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob) by omaliymix on May 7. 2012. [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob) then griefed the base and killed everyone, but [THEJudgeHolden](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/THEJudgeHolden) managed to escape with a fly hack [jdw99666](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jdw99666) made. Following the grief of Rapture 2, Judge's Group went on a long hiatus until 2016. Some members later built at [Rapture 3](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rapture_3), although it was not a Judge's Group project.

### Snow Town
Following a long cessation of activities of Judge's Group, Snow Town was founded, with members including Offtopia, jdw99666, elocdrof, [willyroof](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/willyroof), marksman77, rickenman, chrisleighton, [levi17](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/levi17), and [passie05](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/passie05). The base fizzled out after long periods of inactivity, and was later griefed by [Tim_McNukepants](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Tim_McNukepants) in 2019, after he paid for the coordinates, thinking they were those of [Viper Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Viper_Base). Willyroof's dog from Ravendal had been at the base that entire time, and as a result has led to claims of it being one of the oldest on the server.
### The Drain
Main Article:[The Drain](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Drain)

The Drain is considered to be the last Judge's Group base, since many of the original members were there such as [willyroof](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/willyroof), [Offtopia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Offtopia), and [THEJudgeHolden](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/THEJudgeHolden).

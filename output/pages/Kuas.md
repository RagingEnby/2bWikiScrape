## History
Kuas joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) in March 2021. After escaping spawn, he met [aodrael](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/aodrael), who invited him to [The Order](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Order). He based with them at [Whitehaven (Order Base)](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Order#Whitehaven), and befriended [A32K](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/A32K), [Gilded_Apple](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Gilded_Apple), [Cynappse](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Cynappse), and [Soiled](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Soiled) in the process.

After becoming more familiar with the server, he became a member of the [Watchmen](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Watchmen) in mid-2022, where he befriended [Davinch](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Davinch) and [NeoPaladin](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/NeoPaladin); he later started a base with them. He also helped in the construction of the [OwO](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Watchmen#OwO), and later with [Rick Astley](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Watchmen#Rick_Astley).

Following the disbandment of Watchmen, he continued to build with friends he made in the group. He joined [Spectrum Builders](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spectrum_Builders) (then called 'Conquest Logistics') in late 2022, and assisted in [Project Dead](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Project_Dead).

}}**Fenrir** was a base founded by [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86) and [Pyrobyte](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pyrobyte) that was notable for bringing [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria) and the [Gape Group](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Gape_Group) together.

## History
Fenrir was founded by [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86) and [Pyrobyte](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pyrobyte) after the original [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria_(Base)) was griefed. Soon after this, 2b2t began having some major lag issues, and many players moved over to 3b3t for a while to escape the lag. It was on 3b3t that Sato and Pyrobyte met up with members of the Gape Group, including [James_Rustles](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/James_Rustles) and [Caleesii](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/List_of_pre-june_players#C), and founded [Nova](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nova). After most of the lag issues were resolved on 2b2t, many members of the Gape group traveled to Fenrir and began building there. The base continued to expand until March 2015, when Sato announced that everyone still at Fenrir should move to the next major Valkyrian base, [Asgard II](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Asgard_II). The base was abandoned, and was griefed over the next few years by various players. In mid-2019, Miggers and LordPopcwrn heavily re-griefed the base, which at that point was still relatively intact.

## Builds
Satoâ€™s only major build at Fenrir was the large fortress by the ocean, which contained a white tree at the top. There were no real guidelines for what to build at the base, but many players ended up making extensive use of spruce wood, as it was readily available. Coconut4 built a replica of the Eiffel Tower out of brown wool, which was eventually struck by lightning and burned down. Just like the original [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria_(Base)), this base had a replica of the Spawn Beacon from the [Second Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Second_Incursion). Pyrobyte built a lighthouse, Caleesii built the structure that housed the member board and an underground crop farm, and [ftsqr](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ftsqr) built a large, detailed house out of spruce wood and cobblestone. Other builds included a large clock tower, a gold farm, and the Fenrir Inn.

}}**The Order** is a group that was founded on December 12th, 2020 by [aodrael](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/aodrael) and [CalebBlood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SolarNapalm). The group is known for its "pro-newfag" outlook, and wishes to invite and help players. It also has a focus on trying to improve relations between other groups. The group functions as a democracy, having elections for "Prime Minister" every 4 months, although it maintains aodrael as its king. The Order is a direct rebirth of a previous group called "Unitopia," which was originally founded on August 31st of 2021. The group has around 80 members, 2 known bases, and 50 "outposts," which are smaller bases inhabited by newer members.
## History
The Order was started after [aodrael](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/aodrael) was banned from the [Spawn rangers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer#Donfuer_Sub_Division) on December 12, 2020, a group that he had originally started back in August of 2021 and that was later annexed by [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer). The start of The Order was followed by an extended tense period between them and DonFuer. The Order then allied with [The Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Republic) against [D_loaded](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/D_loaded) in order to stop his insiding attempts. The Order was shortly annexed by the [Hospitallers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hospitallers) (run by The Republic) in order to make aodrael disappear. It only lasted a month as it wasn’t working, and the group moved on as DonFuer concentrated more on The Republic until the conflict died out. The Order helped to revive The [Democratic Group Alliance](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Democratic_Group_Alliance) (now known as the League of Based Groups) with the help of [SoiledCold](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SoiledCold) and The Republic. The first Prime Minister was [KillerShark716](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KillerShark716), and he and aodrael wrote the Constitution for The Order. They then founded Whitehaven (not to be confused with [Whitehaven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Whitehaven)) in February 2021 as their first main base. aodrael then began inviting various members, such as Kuas, Gilded_Apple, and Cyynapse. In March, the group attempted to kick out a younger member, as Cyynapse was uncomfortable having kids in the group. However, due to Cyynapse's naiveté, the member was able to escape, and the group decided to grief the base themselves. Cyynapse has since been disallowed of any executive decisions without aodrael's approval. On August 14, 2021 the group would rebrand to simply "The Order" as a means of simplifying the group, but the group would go inactive soon after.

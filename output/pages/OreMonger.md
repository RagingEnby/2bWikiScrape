#REDIRECT [OreMonger](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/OreMonger)dfag](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Social_Classes) who played from 2011 to 2016. He was a well-known griefer who is known for griefing the rebuilt version of the original [Valkyria](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Valkyria_(Base)).

## History
OreMonger joined 2b2t in 2011 and settled close to spawn with his friend, [KingSplash](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KingSplash). In 2012, he raided and destroyed [The_fox's](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_fox) [base](https://i.imgur.com/7i2KFdE.png). This sparked The_fox's long-time and very vocal hate. For his first three years, he played with the chat off. In this time he spent his time building and searching for bases to loot. In 2014, OreMonger started reading and participating in chat, and took on a public anti-bigotry stance, including using the username BigotryIsBad. OreMonger's base lasted several years until 2014. In 2014, OreMonger found [Zach3397](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Zach3397)'s dupe stash at [SnackyNorph](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SnackyNorph)'s old [Library](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Snacky%27s_Library). According to hear-say, OreMonger found [Javazon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Javazon) already raiding the base. OreMonger managed to kill Javazon and loot the majority of the dupe stash before Javazon got back (Javazon had a bed set within 40 minutes travel). At this point, Javazon griefed [Kaamtown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Kaamtown) and a few other locations and was able to falsely convince the 2b2t population that Oremonger was working with Javazon or was his alt. At the time, Javazon was so despised on the server that on June 6th, 2014, as many as 20 players including [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2), [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa), [stormtroopah](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/stormtroopah), [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013), [iTristan](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/iTristan), [Pyrobyte](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pyrobyte), and [popbob](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/popbob) went to Oremonger's 2011 base (found with popbob's thunder exploit) and griefed it.

Following the destruction of his base, he spent months creating new bases which all were found via coordinate hacks and got destroyed. OreMonger was disliked due to his anti-bigotry stance, as well as the fact that he built massive, laggy redstone contraptions at almost all of his bases, and he was often harassed in chat. Oremonger would reportedly rise to many of his adversaries insults in chat - his consistent reaction and engagement with them no doubt made him a larger target for harassment. After this incident, he'd stay at his and [KingSplash](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KingSplash)'s Mesa Base until it was griefed by [Sato86](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sato86) and others on April 4th, 2015. Mysteriously, spawning unlimited withers was enabled and shortly thereafter disabled for this grief. He'd move to another base until it was discovered during the /tell exploit after the [Third Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Third_Incursion) on June 1st, 2015; iTristan and popbob would ask Oremonger to base with him. He accepted their offer, buying time to move items from his base, and a few days later destroyed the base himself.

After this event, [Branillon](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Branillon) invited OreMonger and several others to [King's Landing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/King%27s_Landing). However, iTristan joined this base as well and accidentally leaked the base while trolling Oremonger in early October 2015. After [King's Landing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/King%27s_Landing) was griefed, OreMonger moved to [KinoGrad Base](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/KinoGrad_Base) (KGB) along with many other members of [King's Landing](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/King%27s_Landing). In early 2016, he griefed [Olympus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Olympus) along with [drewbookman](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/drewbookman). However, KGB would also be griefed by [The Tyranny](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Nerds_Inc) on April 20th, 2016. After the Tyranny's Week of Destruction, Oremonger would leave 2b2t indefinitely and has played primarily on [Constantiam](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Constantiam) since.

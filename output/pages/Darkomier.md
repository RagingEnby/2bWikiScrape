**Darkomier** is a builder and a high-ranking member of [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer).

## History
### Early History
Darkomier joined 2b2t for the first time on June 27th, 2022, with his friend [Shabby08](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Shabby08). Together, they made a small outpost together in the millions. Soon after the outpost was set up, Darkomier wanted to build with other players, so he applied to DonFuer, officially being recruited on July 8th, 2022, with his first base with the group being [SpawnFuer 27](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SpawnFuer_27). Darkomier built at a series of SpawnFuer spawnbases with the group which ended with [Don Darko](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Don_Darko), the largest SpawnFuer ever built. The base lasted for 6 weeks, although it only had a few players building there.

### Aureus Rebuild and DonFuer Leadership
While Darkomier was building at Don Darko, he was invited to build at the [Aureus City 2022 Rebuild](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Aureus_City_2022_Rebuild). He spent many days and nights building the project. After a week of sustained activity and building, the base was 100% rebuilt. A few weeks after that, project was finished, so he travelled to [DonFuer 25](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer_25). Darkomier built several parts of the base, such as the 'Lucky 38' Casino, multiple player statues, and the subway system.

Darkomier became a Noble in DonFuer December 26th, 2022, and helps to lead the group together with the other nobles and elders.

Darkomier was one of the first members of the group to be invited to build at [Donfuer 28](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Donfuer_28). He built several islands at the base, being one of the largest contributors at the base.
After the destruction of Donfuer 28, Darkomier decided to take a break from the server to focus on other things, but he is still active in Donfuer as a group.

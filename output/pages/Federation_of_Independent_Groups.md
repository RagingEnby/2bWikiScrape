## History
The original concept was known as the Astral protectorate. Under this, all groups jay_monroe claimed were to be under the Astral fold, come together, then eventually rejoin either as states of [The Astral Republic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Astral_Republic) or be absorbed within the group itself. However, jay_monroe had a grudge against [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium) for taking his Assile idea, which [TheDark_Emperor](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheDark_Emperor) denies as the idea for the [UGE](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/United_Group_Embassy) came about between him and [Ericudo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Ericudo). What jay_monroe wanted was to create his own UGE known as FIG, Federation of Independent Groups. PopeViper went ahead and began preparations whilst jay_monroe created the discord.

Its first member states were [BsB(The Backstreet Boys of 2b2t)](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Backstreet_Boys) led by iMems and The Space Force led by JudySmall. The first meeting would spiral into an insult slinging competition between Imems, JudySmall, and jay_monroe. Imems calling F.I.G a power grab, JudySmall calling iMems a piece of shit ,and jay_monroe saying that The Astral Republic was superior to both of them, spawning from its creation therefore they were his substates by right. It was the jumping off point for the FIG concept, but the idea continued. A few rules were called into question: whether substates would be allowed, how a vow of neutrality should be allowed, and exceptions for member states of the Astral Protectorate. This would put into a different spiral of issues. The fact of the immensely lonely amount of groups. There were seemingly only [VoCo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Vortex_Coalition),[Highland](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highland), and Emperium substates as other groups Which would make it hard to disassemble the groups as their members were already close to Emperium or other groups. This put into question how exactly they could make FIG even work. Then came along the group construction plan. PopeViper would make the group construction plan concept to stir jay_monroe along. They would recruit people into smaller groups or factions specialized for specific things. Using the pseudonym of a completely different company like system, Astral people would be CEOs of sorts. Once the smaller groups got to a specific size, They would be moved over to their own discord owned by one of the trusted Astral leaders within those groups. They would then be moved to FIG. The groups that were liked were cherry picked enough to turn it into a member state. The member state would fall apart and would make the group larger. The project idea was meant to populate the server with new factions ,since the death of the many group due to inter group conflicts. PopeViper told him what they could do with it and . jay_monroe then said Viper's eyes were too big for his stomach. jay_monroe co-opted the idea and got the [Inquisition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Inquisition) (lead by LeeMastah) as his first group enlargement substate. Which he was planning to pick apart. However, his mistake was not knowing PopeViper had told LeeMastah and DanThePokemario everything. DanThePokemario told JudySmall and iMems, so they backed out. It didn't get far because jay_monroe lost all motivation after DanThePokemario got council.

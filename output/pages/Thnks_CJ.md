## History
### Early History
Thnks_CJ joined [2b2t](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t) for the first time in September 2021 after watching various videos by [SalC1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/SalC1) and [Fit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fit). He was accompanied by his close friends at the time, [DanielC07](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DanielC07) and [Law](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Law). They founded 'PTF Spawn Base' together, although it was swiftly abandoned, with the three then co-founding [Phaedra](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Phaedra) together. Following this, [Law](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Law) and CJ joined [Imperials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Imperials), and Phaedra became an Imperials base. CJ went inactive for several months before coming back in November and continuing with the group.

### The Collective
When many of the high-ranking Imperials members left the group on February 23, 2022, he left with them, and became a high-ranking member of the group they started together; [The Collective](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Collective). He became a member of the [Council](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Collective#Ranks) soon thereafter, and helped to develop a discord bot for them to manage bases and members with easily.

### Donfuer
Thnks_CJ joined donfuer with the purpose of helping them with keeping up with the lastest in programming technology within the 2b2t community, this included custom proxies and custom utility clients.

## Sync Client
Thnks_CJ joined the Sync Development team (previously just [Skillnoob_](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Skillnoob_), [Taxionic](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Taxionic) and [Bloeckchengrafik](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Bloeckchengrafik)) on May 1st and resumed development on the client after it had not had updates in several months. Much of his work to the client was geared towards the loader and overall security, but nontheles served to bring it active again. The client itself is still private but the discord is still active and regular updates on the status of the project are posted.

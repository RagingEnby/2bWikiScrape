}}The Teutonic Order is a Roman Catholic group founded by Takeouts due to the influx of Taiwanese players and the activity of the [8th incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Eighth_Incursion). This group was created as the revision of [Gambino’s Crusade](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Crusade), when Takeouts got explicit permission to build upon the group.

## History
The Teutonic Order was founded in July 10th, 2019. In its early stages, the group were primarily leaking Taiwanese bases on their discord server and letting the community do the rest. The main purpose of the group was to improve 2b2t, depending upon it’s circumstances. Promotions were primarily earned by building monuments/bases for the group once trusted. Members were also rewarded for recruiting new members.

The group was also known for bedtrapping and griefing various VoCo events/bases and doing various group events. On March, 7th, 2020 the group purged several members and renovated its ranks.

After 2 years of inactivity, Takeouts returned to the server and revived his group, with two [DonFuer](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/DonFuer) base griefs. This sparked interest in his group and it is now one of the larger groups on the server. Like most groups on 2b2t, The Teutonic Order operates out of their [public discord server.](https://discord.gg/TTO)<br />

# Hare_Hare_Yukai

**Hare_Hare_Yukai** is a 2019 player, who is most known for being the first person to dig to the Nether World Border on 2b2t. He has also been a big contributor to the groups [Motorway Extension Gurus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Motorway_Extension_Gurus), [Highway Workers Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Highway_Workers_Union) and [Spectrum Builders](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spectrum_Builders), and helped code plugin that was used in the project to create the obsidian spawn roof 10k x 10k in 2022.

## History
Hare_Hare_Yukai started on 2b2t in 2019. He escaped spawn without any issues, and started getting settled on the server. He built a simple mapart, and continued to play solo for the rest of the year. After playing on the server on and off for a year, he decided to use his coding skills for his next project. In December of 2020 he began planning out his first project.

### Konata Izumi's Road
That December, he started planning to dig a tunnel that went to the Nether World Border. This was something that had not been done yet. Digging 30 million blocks was also not only time consuming, but also a logistic challenge. The first couple of weeks were spent gathering resources as well as designing a strategy to repair the used pickaxes. Instead of mending the pickaxes, he decided to repair them with an anvil, which proved to be 10 times more effective.

The initial digging started on 24th February 2021, and was successfully finished 12th May 2021 when Yukai became the first person ever to travel to the Nether World Border legitimately. Upon reaching the Nether World Border, he noticed chunks that had already been generated.  After some investigating, he found signs from other players such as [IronException](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IronException) and [TheLampGod](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/TheLampGod). He later found out that they used an 8x teleportation exploit to get to the World Border back in March of 2020.

### MEG Nether World Border Highways MegaProject
After finishing the trip to the Nether World Border, he would look for another project to do. Together with the group [Motorway Extension Gurus](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Motorway_Extension_Gurus), they would construct a plan to make highways to all the Nether World Borders. On the axis highways, the tunnel was planned to be paved for 6x4, and on diagonal sections they would do 7x4. Yukai helped dig +Z highway, -Z highway, and all the corner highways. This was a project that took over two years. The last highway that was completed was the +- Corner highway, at 26th May 2023.

### Project Circlestrafe
In 2021, Yukai was motivated to try to search for the Farlands on 2b2t; something that had a small chance of being generated on 2b2t when the server was on versions where it would've been possible. If the Farlands were to exist, it would mean that the terrain was generated before September of 2011. He started around July of 2021, and planned to fly around the entire 12.550.821 offset, which is where farlands would've started to generate if the chunks had been loaded. He coded a custom module that would world download everything, and fly automatically. All together, he flew over 100 million blocks, and the project lasted until February of 2022.

### Project Dead - 100 Million Obsidian Square
Around July of 2022, Yukai would help make the obsidian square at spawn that would cover 5k spawn radius at the world height limit. He would help code the [Lambda](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Lambda) plugin that was used for the project, and was one of the top 5 pavers/miners for the project. In total, the project used 100 million obsidian, and was successful, covering spawn with a layer of obsidian 5k by 5k wide.

### Present Activity
Yukai has been working on coding a plugin that would be used to automate highway tools to be used for terraforming large areas. The plugin was used to clear terrain for large farms and for other events, such as a Christmas Event. He would go on to help with the Nether Grid Project , which was a project that made highways every 5k in the 50k nether radius, making travelling around nether spawn much easier for everyone. Since then, he has been helping expanding and continuing the Southern Canal together with the [Waterway Union](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/WaterWay_Union).

In early 2023, Yukai would discover how 2b2t's regeneration plugin worked. He would figure out how to make end gateway towers with it, allowing for quick teleportation. He used a method to create NBTless Gateways, which would hyperlink with a gateway that would then appear at end spawn. Wherever he would make these gateways, if he wanted to, he could generate gateways at spawn which would teleport a player to the location where he made the original gateway towers, often at world borders. By combining his knowledge about the regen plugin, he could use World RNG manipulation to create HARUHI bedrock logo.

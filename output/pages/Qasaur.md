**Qasaur** is a Reddit user who created [the 2b2t subreddit](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Subreddit) on March 25, 2012, and now moderates it alongside u/2builders2tools. He created his account on October 31, 2011. He played on 2b2t in 2012, and it is likely that he was a friend of the original [Hausemaster](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Hausemaster) due to him speaking Swedish and posting on Swedish subreddits ([account](https://www.reddit.com/user/Qasaur/)). He may have played on [the *Garry's Mod* server](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/2b2t_(Garry%27s_Mod_server)), as he played a lot of *Garry's Mod* as seen in 2010 archives of his Steam account.

In regard to what you said about those individual group pages, I was kind of thinking the same thing, but at the same time we can't just delete them all because they make up quite a large part of the wiki.

I was thinking maybe they could be used as a more in-depth description of matches, like stating what the speedrun was, what game they played, who the guest commentators were and maybe a few images of key points in the match.

The main pages can be used as more or less of an overview of who won and how many points they have. That's what I think, but it's up to you.

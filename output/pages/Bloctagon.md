**Bloctagon** was formerly an overseer of [Builders Haven](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Builders_Haven) and a member of [The Freelancers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Freelancers). He joined in 2017 under the name hias97, remaining generally antisocial. In 2018 he began to build with others, and eventually joined many discords, leading him to the Builder's haven project.

Bloctagon contributed to [Beardler](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Beardler)'s demise in the [BoeMeccan Witch Trials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BoeMeccan_Witch_Trials) by initiating the communication between [YellowstoneJoe](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/YellowstoneJoe) and [Beardler](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Beardler) (who was a base mate of Bloctagon's during the drama). He then, after leaking his discord messages with Beardler to the 2b2t subreddit, was invited to 2 bases, joining [The Freelancers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Freelancers) and befriending [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Emperium) soon after. Bloctagon has never leaked a base nor a stash to anyone.

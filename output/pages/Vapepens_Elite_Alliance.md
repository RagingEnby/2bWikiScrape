}}**VEA** (also known as **Vapepens Eats Ass** and **Vapepens Elite Alliance**) is a building group that builds primarily in and around [Spawn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn). The VEA tries to create a laid back environment for 2b2t players but is also known for getting into many controversies. The group's name originally comes from the phrase "Vapepens eats ass" which is the moto of the group. It is tradition that all members of the VEA have to say "Vapepens eats ass" to be initiated and many of the members consistently put the phrase in chat and on signs around the server.

## History
VEA was founded in September 2022 under the name of 'Invisible Knights' by the player Vapepens. The group was formed after the original members started a continuation of [The Invisible Castle](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Invisible_Castle) together. After a conflict relating to the base with [Raaanch](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Raaanch) and [chiekn](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/chiekn), the base was abandoned and the group went inactive. During this period of inactivity, the base was griefed. The group became active again afterwards and rebranded to 'VEA' in January 2023 as part of an effort to create a larger group as well as changing the leadership to having both [VapePens](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/VapePens) and [Stalpo](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Stalpo) as co-leaders. During this time the VEA became much more active and the member count grew to around 30 members. Along with expanding the group, they also allied with [The Travelers](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Travelers).

The Travelers merged into the VEA in August 2023, boosting the group to 50+ members. With this change, the leaders became a circle of 5 including: VapePens, Stalpo, [i23d1x](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/i23d1x), [Saff_cozzie](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Saff_cozzie), and [Mako10301](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Mako10301).

In Early 2024, VEA sought to become the first group to create a new Logo at Spawn at the new build limit established during the 1.19 update. Members of the group worked together to create a large VEA Logo with obsidian and crying obsidian, making it the first of its kind created on 2b2t. There would be attempts by [Spawn Builders Association](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Spawn_Builders_Association) members to remove the logo, but after many PVP encounters, the battles subsided with some limited damage being done to the VEA Logo.

VEA has had multiple bases since it was founded, each with a special theme.

In April 2024, [Chromatown](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Chromatown) was founded by Vapepens. Afterwards many trusted friends were invited to come build. The theme of the base was a large multi-colored base. Many members of the group came to build at the base, and it was the most successful base for VEA up until that point. It was griefed on November 29th, 2024 by [The Enclave](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Enclave).

## Events
Each week, VEA hosts public events on the server, building bases for each event.

Bases are constructed for these various events, most recently [Deadwood](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Deadwood).

VEA also works with well known players in the community to bring many groups on the server together for these events such as [Jacktherippa](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Jacktherippa) and [Fastvincent1](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Fastvincent1).

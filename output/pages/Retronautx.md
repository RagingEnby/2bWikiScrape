**Retronautx**, or simply **Retronaut/Retro**, is most notable on 2b2t for being the leader of the group [Infrared](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Infrared). He joined in early September 2017 with his friend Rustbound, who created the group Inferno. He is a good friend of notable players [maxtorcd55](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/maxtorcd55), [IHackedWalmart](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/IHackedWalmart), and [jared2013](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/jared2013). He resisted against the [Sixth Incursion](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/6th_Incursion) because of his hatred for many of the groups participating in the incursion.

## History
### Early Days (September 2017 - October 2017)
Retronaut joined the server sometime in early September 2017 during the [ElRichMC](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/ElRichMC) incursion. He went unnoticed for around 1.5 months while building a base at 1 million overworld. One day, Retronaut got bored of playing alone and decided to message some random people that had nice skins in the tab menu. Retronaut messaged [Metrez](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Metrez) and complimented his skin, and the two became friends. Retro and Metrez planned to meet up at spawn together and Metrez was willing to give Retro some gear. After this, Retronaut met other players at spawn such as IHackedWalmart and Azurilex/Incorporations. Walmart and Azurilex helped out Retro by giving him a small amount of gear. Azurilex then asked Retro if he wanted to join his base a few days later and he said yes. The base was going fine until one day Azurilex suddenly disappeared. After Retro assumed he was gone for good, Retronaut invited Metrez to help him steal much of the Killet gear that Azurilex had left. Retronaut asked Metrez if he wanted to make a base and he agreed. They made a base approximately 500k in the overworld, but the project was abandoned after a few weeks and was later found griefed.

### Creation & Downfall of Inferno + Creation of Infrared (November 2017 - Present)
Retronaut’s long time friend Rustbound had re-joined 2b2t around late October 2017 and desired to create a team. Around October 20th, Team Inferno was born and founded by Rustbound with Retronaut second in command. Inferno was grown by recruiting newfags at spawn and also inviting Retronaut’s friends IHackedWalmart and Metrez. Team Inferno was weakened in the aftermath of the Vo-Perium war. During early January 2018, Retronaut and Rustbound would come into conflict with one another, with Rustbound eventually leaving the Inferno. Retronaut would restructure the group into Infrared and lead it with the help of maxtorcd55 and IHackedWalmart. Retronaut greatly opposed the 6th Incursion because of his hatred for [Emperium](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Emperium) and their allies and his sympathy for newfags. Retronaut was once well known for spawnfagging, but became more of a builder and helper to new players. Infrared became one of the most controversial 2b2t groups of the time because of their feuds with numerous factions.

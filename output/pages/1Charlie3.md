## History
### Bases and maparts
In 2018, 1Charlie3 joined Builders Haven and built at Purgatory and [Purgatory 2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Purgatory_2). After the grief of Purgatory 2 and the [BoeMeccan Witch Trials](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/BoeMeccan_Witch_Trials), Charlie was promoted to Project Overseer. He went on to build at the remaining two Builders Haven temporary bases, [Purgatory 4](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Purgatory_4) and [Exposition](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Exposition). At Exposition he built his first mapart, "Billy Joel".

After the Builders Haven stash was raided and the group disbanded, he joined his fellow Haven members at Valerian. There he built many buildings and made the 3D maparts "Nas", "Biggy Smalls" and his contribution to the server-wide Last Supper mapart. He also remade his Billy Joel mapart here.

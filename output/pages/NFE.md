**Negative Fourhundred Eighthundred**, or just **NFE** was a spawnbase and sanctuary, originally built by a facepunch user and the early home to [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2) and alex02028. Today, the majority of the spawnbase is encased in a giant [lavacast](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/lavacast), but there are some features that can be made out and are still standing today.

Due to it being only about 900 blocks away from spawn it was easily griefed, but it took 2 years for the base to finally go down due to the defense of xcc2 and his basemates.

## History
NFE was started in early 2011 by Pimpmastaflex and possibly other anonymous [Facepunch](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Facepunch) players. It started as a castle and was presumed to be abandoned by xcc when he arrived at it. [xcc2](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/xcc2) repaired the castle along with another player named [alex02028](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/alex02028). Months later, many players had heard of the base around the server and was a popular attraction. xcc and alex02028 offered food and gear to new players who came to NFE. Due to the base's popularity and proximity to spawn, NFE was repeatedly griefed and repaired. In one case the base was covered in a lavacast, the creator of which fell to their death after the cast was removed. [x0XP](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/x0XP) and Cold_Storage77 eventually aided alex and xcc in defense with x0XP later naming the base. Finnish griefers named [Pyylaandia](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Pyylaandia) repeatedly griefed NFE, repeatedly destroying the base to such an extent as to cause alex02028 to permanently leave the server and xcc2 to move to other bases such as [Plugin Town](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Plugin_Town). The base was completely destroyed after the introduction of withers. In late 2020 NFE was restored for 2b2t's 10th anniversary by a few friends.

## Description
The base originally had a four-pillared castle connected by walls, with one pillar extending up to 128, build limit at the time. The base, through efforts by xcc2 and alex02028, gained an aqueduct, drum tower and arched double towers topped with red wool.

## Re-construction
In December 2020, a team of 12 people lead by [VillagerFilms](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/VillagerFilms), [Crazyguy_123](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Crazyguy_123), and [TheMlgFox](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/theMLGFox) went and fully restored the NFE to its original state, for a party that would be held on December 19, 2020, for some of the pre-June players. Some of the people who showed up were [Byrnsy](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Byrnsy), [Passie05](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Passie05), xcc2, [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) and [kingoros](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/kingoros). Eventually the base was griefed by [Armorsmith](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Armorsmith).

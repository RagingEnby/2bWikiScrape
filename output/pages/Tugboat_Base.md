**8000 Base**, (often known as **Tugboat Base**), was a base which was built by [The Fellowship of the Diamond](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/The_Fellowship_of_the_Diamond) sometime in 2012. It was amongst the last bases of the Fellowship before they all quit after their resurgence in 2015.

## History of the Base
The base was built near Spawn, like many of Fellowship's bases in mid 2012. It consisted of a large cobblestone castle, a stone brick tower, and a cartoon-style tugboat in a harbor outside the castle. The tugboat is how the base got its common name due to not many people knowing its original name.

In 2013, most members of the Fellowship  quit 2b2t. Tugboat Base became abandoned, and also griefed later in the year. In 2014, individual players came across the griefed Tugboat Base and it was gradually rebuilt by many players. When the Fellowship eventually resurfaced in 2015, it returned, and the signature Tugboat was built there. It sat mostly untouched to the [Rusher War](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Rusher_War), when [Joey_Coconut](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Joey_Coconut) came to the base in late July of 2016, and established himself there with a group of rushers operating a [Sanctuary](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Sanctuary). They constructed a large melon farm, which helped to get many new players out from spawn. The base was griefed shortly after they left. Joey_Coconut and [Drachenstien](https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Drachenstien) attempted to repair the damage the following year, with most of the base being brought back to its pre-2016 state, before it was later griefed again.
